Well I took a pregnancy test just in case and it came back positive. Has this happened to anyone? I don‚Äôt know far along I was and how I could have been pregnant if I got a period? It was just one large clot and the bleeding has stopped. Any insight???

Looking for some advice. I‚Äôve just experienced my 2nd Chemical Pregnancy in 4 months. We‚Äôve been trying since last May/June. 

I have also had a previous loss with another partner in 2014 - although I think I could‚Äôve been slightly further along on that one (maybe 6weeks?) 

So far we have both had private testing that seems normal - me an Ultrasound and him an SA. My 21 day bloods showed no sign of ovulation as I had a wonky cycle and ovulated a few days afterward. Normally 29 days and I have been tracking ovulation with OPK and Temps.

I have a referral for Gynae with the NHS but I would imagine their testing is likely to be similar to what we‚Äôve already paid for. My doctor doesn‚Äôt seem to be concerned at these losses, but I am losing hope very quickly. Should I at least push for a new CD21 blood test to see if I might have low progesterone? 

Thanks."

I only got barely-there squinters on 25 hcg threshold internet cheapies both cycles too. I had some hope this time as I had stronger symptoms, but it's all just gone so quickly.

I just feel like this process is a joke. This is my second cycle trying for a baby- both times were chemicals. I have Hashimoto's and PCOS, but since my TSH and thyroid are fine and for the moment I'm ovulating regularly (13/14dpo + 11-day luteal phase) I feel like things should be okay. I know this could still be chance but it just feels very cruel.

I know it's unlikely any doctor will do anything for 2 chemicals, but should I be advocating for anything? I will ask for a re-test of my TSH/T4 just in case things have changed there."
