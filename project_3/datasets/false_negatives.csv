I wanted to take a moment (edit: or not, this ended up being a REALLY long post) to share my personal experience with SIS and HSG because I know up until I went for these tests myself, I literally read every single experience I could find on Reddit to help quell some of my anxiety. I combed every day looking for a fresh post. It seems experiences are wildly variable, so I just thought I’d add my 2 cents to the pot.

I started my TTC journey with my RE by scheduling my HSG at the hospital I work at for convenience. I read every single Reddit post I could about the HSG and was well aware of the test’s reputation. When I went, a nice rad tech asked me to take a pregnancy test (I tried to reason that I’m gay and was told “well you never know” ugh lol). I stripped from the waist down, signed my consent, and was laid down on a table with stirrups and a large x-ray machine above it. A radiology department PA came in and detailed what she’d be doing. I was very anxious at this point but felt confident that it’d be over soon. I thought wrong. She basically rammed the speculum and opened it to max all in one motion. I was in tears from this as I’ve never had any clinician be SO blatantly rough. She attempted multiple times to insert the catheter, which felt like a searing, pinching cramp and I also kept feeling a strange (but not painful) popping feeling. She sighed and said she couldn’t get the catheter in. She paged the radiologist, who told her to try using a dilator. I had a brief moment where I thought to object, but just really wanted to get it over with so I let her try. I’m fairly certain being stabbed in the vagina with a hot firepoker would have hurt less. I started screaming in pain. It was far and away the worst pain I have ever felt, so painful and mind numbing that I was reduced to total fight of flight mode trying to scramble away. I had to shriek for her to stop and almost fell off the X-day table. After she finally removed everything and looked at me with an incredulous “wow, really?” look, I just curled up into a ball on the table and sobbed. The radiologist suggested I must have cervical stenosis and I’d need to have this procedure under anesthesia. I trudged back to my office in the hospital with my head hanging low. I felt completely emotionally and physically violated. I’d never read a single post detailing a similar experience to mine and balked at the idea of ever going through that again.

I called my RE’s office when I got home. They told me I’d need to come in for a saline sonogram with my RE so he could see more what’s going on. At this point, I really didn’t mentally think I could do it, so I took a week off to catch my breath. The setup was very similar for the saline sonogram as the HSG, except it was done in an exam room on a regular exam table. I stripped from the waist down and waited for my RE. He was apologetic and ensured me there was likely nothing wrong with my cervix and that today would be nothing like my experience at the hospital. Unconvinced, I shakily laid down and jumped every time I was touched. This time, the speculum didn’t hurt at all. He started to make small talk with me and cracked a joke, and when I nervously laughed, he said, “guess what? The catheter is in!” I seriously did not feel a thing, which felt like the greatest blessing ever bestowed upon me after the complete horror I experienced at the hospital. He removed the speculum and then inserted the ultrasound probe which was mildly uncomfortable, but not particularly painful (exactly like a regular TVUS - having the catheter in with it did not hurt). Next, the saline was injected. I didn’t really expect this part to hurt, but unfortunately it did. For me the pain felt like very deep, undulating period cramps. It hurt for about a total of 60 seconds and seemed to worsen in intensity as the seconds passed. I was definitely grateful when it was done, but I wouldn’t say it was uncomfortable enough to make me cry. From start to finish the procedure took approximately 3 minutes, with only about 60 seconds of that being quite painful, although I did have some ongoing minor cramping for about 20 minutes after (and randomly later that evening?).

After my saline sonogram, my RE recommended I come back to try again for my HSG with them. I really, really, really did not want to do this, but my saline sonogram was not totally normal and there was some concern I may have a unicornuate uterus and he said we could rule that out if I happened to have 2 patent tubes on HSG. I finally relented and had my HSG this morning. The anxiety leading up to this procedure was 20x worse than the procedure itself. I laid on the X-ray table and tried not to cry. Again, there was no pain with speculum insertion. I did not feel the catheter either (despite apparently the HSG catheter being about double the size of the SIS catheter), but I DID feel the balloon inflation. I had heard that it causes a pinch, but in my experience, the balloon caused repeated undulating cramping very similar to the SIS. It feels like a superficial but moderately intense period cramp. I think I uttered a quick, “ow!” when it happened and then was surprised that it continued to hurt past the initial inflation. RE then injected the dye, which I knew is what most people have issues with. For me, the pain was only slightly more intense than it was with the SIS, although the type of pain was identical. I actually found that although the HSG pain was more intense, it didn’t last as long and stopped as soon as the procedure was done. I think I uttered a curse word at first and then decided to start taking big, long, dramatic breaths instead and that actually helped a lot. The catheter was removed without pain and then RE confirmed for me that I do not have a unicornuate uterus and both tubes are patent. All of the pain I felt during my infertility workup suddenly seemed so inconsequential. Afterwards, I wore a pad (suggest bringing a good one from home because you’ll need more than just a pantyliner) and went to Cheesecake Factory to reward myself!

My subjective pain assessment for SIS = 5/10; for HSG = 7/10, but much briefer than SIS.

Tl;dr: try to have your procedures done in your RE’s office instead of having them done somewhere more convenient. The experience level of the clinician performing these tests absolutely positively *DOES* matter (at least in my case) and having to come back for a redo completely sucks. These tests just suck in general and carry an emotional weight with them that I did not expect. There’s nothing worse than lying on that stupid table in the most vulnerable position there is, not knowing whether you’ll feel nothing or if you’ll be completely brutalized. Still, more likely than not, you will be greatly uncomfortable for less than a minute and then it’ll be over. I can’t overstate enough how important it is to treat yourself afterward! I hope my account helps anyone out there about to have these tests find a shred of comfort about what’s to come!"

Quick vent because it's still annoying me. I recently had a major life event (master's degree) and my in-laws came to visit to celebrate me. My SIL is 21 and recently had a baby with a horrible guy. He's no longer in the picture so my in-laws are helping her.

My niece was sweet and she really took to me. Of course I felt a little sting because my SIL got this when she didn't even want it but I kept using positive self that and enjoyed my time playing with our niece. (I know it's not fair of me to be upset at her for enjoying being a mom but it hurts).

Now, my MIL's friends come to visit and right out of the car they start asking me when I'm getting pregnant... On my big exciting weekend, I ended up being told to do this, do that, try this, I'm trying to hard, and I'll understand it all when I finally have my own. I don't know why I didn't have the confidence to tell them to drop it. It was so frustrating especially considering I'd just had an ultrasound and bloodwork done to look over everything so I was waiting on hearing results.

Why can't people just keep their comments to themselves?"

I’m hoping I’m in the right place. 
My SO and I have been together for two years. We have a little boy (he is not biodad but he is the only father my son has ever known) who is nearly two. We’ve had the odd conversation about names for future kids and he’s said he wanted to look into getting some medical intervention as our attitude from the time little man was around 9 months old has been if it happens it happens. But it hasn’t happened. There’s been a few moments of false hope. He took a paintball to the family jewels about 8 years ago and is now convinced following a loss each with two other partners about 2 years apart that he’s firing blanks. I myself have had one confirmed angel and suspected loss of twins before Little Man came along out of the blue.

At the moment; everybody’s least favourite visitor is in town, so that put the kibbosh on attempting to try this month. However I’m wanting to know if I should sit SO down &amp; discuss actively trying which would mean both of us would have to make some significant changes to our lifestyle (quitting smoking; exercising a little more etc) I’m willing to do it; however I’ve already told my SO I’m unwilling to do IVF if he doesn’t get a SC done first as it could be all for nothing. He completely agrees with that as he’s already said that he won’t put me through excessive hormones being injected into me daily if it’s on his end we can’t conceive. 

How do I approach this?"

I just really need to get this off my chest. I had a miscarriage on June 17th, 2020. My husband's step mother was incredibly condescending. We had told them that I was pregnant and miscarried at 7 weeks on fathers day, and she scoffed and said ""Well, were you *even trying*?"" And both he and i were incredibly hurt by her. The following weekend he went over to their house (which is a 2.5 hr drive, mind you) and she stuck to her guns, saying that she doesnt believe we're ready to be parents, and too many babies are born to parents who arent ready and then the babies are abused. So, in essence, she said that we would be terrible, abusive parents... and that was that - I cut off all communication since.

Fast forward to the past weekend, my husband tells me that it wasnt him they were worried about, that it was *me*! His father had told him these exact words that day: ""We arent worried about your abilities as a father, but we dont think she is ready to be a mother. I dont think she should have had the baby, she just doesnt have to ability to be a good mother."" 

How the FFFFFF do I deal with my relationship with them now? That bell cant be unrung. We are trying again, but I dont ever want them involved in my life again. I dont want them in my childrens lives, either. How do I move forward in my relationship with them and my future kids relationships with them? Any advice welcome."

I never knew trying was so hard. That must sound so dumb to many of you. But my husband and I have fallen pregnant twice, both times with literally no effort (other than the obvious). 

This time we're 3mo in with no baby in sight, and I'm starting to comprehend that emotional roller coaster I've heard so much about. Ouch. 

Add to it, and this is the real vent, my husband and I, who are usually in near perfect harmony, had our worst ever fight today. It was about a lot of things, but the part that drew proverbial blood was his parenting. He thinks I think he's a shit dad. I don't, but I definitely think he expects totally unreasonable things from our nearly 2yo son, and it's causing unnecessary and damaging battles. 

Hubby then dropped a bomb on me - he said he doesn't enjoy parenting. He loves our son, wouldn't change having him, likes hanging out with him, but doesn't overall like parenting. 

I nearly died when he said that. He wanted kids, not me. OK, kid. I'm the one who's wanted to go for number 2. And after today, I really think I might just let it rest a couple months, wait for life to maybe be less shit. 

Because of course there's covid, the inexorable boa constrictor. And where I live there was just a devastating storm, followed by more damaging winds. We've come through unscathed but within blocks there are people entering their 4th day with no power and no water. 

And my state is in HARD lockdown. No school, childcare, going to work, going more than 5km. Now with the wind damage, I'm afraid to go outside because we're in a forest so the trees will drop weakened branches for days yet. Someone was crushed by a tree at my local supermarket 3 days ago. One of my mates in a volunteer fire-fighter and was with thr poor bloke as he died. I don't have the emotional resilience to handle that. 

And to top it all off, we had truly awful, terrifying, heart wrenching bushfire 6mo ago, and the latest storms have reminded me of what it feels like to be afraid of nature. The next state over has just reported its first fire for the season, even though it's still winter. How there's anything left to burn, I don't know. 

I'm tired, scared, hurt, angry, but most of all I'm just so so sad. Sad that my happiness at wanting another baby is dissolving into heartache, sad that my wonderful husband isn't loving being a dad as much as I love being a mum, sad that my goddamn country is burning, drowning or blowing away, sad that we can't see family, sad that when I finally get to see someone other than my husband I won't be able to get a hug... 

Thanks for listening. I just needed to talk, and I don't want to tell any of this to anyone who knows us. I'd hate any of our friends to think less of my husband as a father because he doesn't deserve that, and so many people have it SO MUCH worse - hell I'm nearly the only one in my mum's group who hasn't lost power this week, who isn't struggling for money or with working from home, whose kid sleeps... 

I just want a big sleep and a nice day at a park. I can't have either, but I will again. Someday. Maybe there'll be 1 kid with me, maybe 2. I hope it's 2, and I hope my beautiful husband is there smiling next to me in the sun."

“Trainer has some great news! She’s pregnant, lets all give her a round of applause!”

We all sat there and clapped for her pregnancy and all I wanted to do was scream and yell and walk out of the room. Apparently my trigger isn’t death, overdoses, child abuse or murder ... it’s pregnancy!

Now I'm 3 days away from when I expect to ovulate, and my vaginal discharge has a very very strong fishy smell and a brown color. I've never ever experienced this. It started as a dark yellow color and now it's been 5 days and it is now a brown color and still smells fishy. I'm scheduling a gyno appointment... but I'm just disappointed and frustrated. 

We haven't had sex in about 3 weeks due to visiting family members staying with us, and then delayed it a few days longer so we could just catch my ovulation window. But now we can't even. I'm sexually frustrated and I just want to be with my man, and I wanted to have a chance to make a baby. But now I can't even. All I want is some sex!!! But my vagina is angry and fishy and unhappy."

Didn’t feel like I had been trying for long enough to rant, but I need some place to vent because I feel like I’m starting to drive people around me crazy. 

We started trying in October 2018, had a first trimester mmc in December and haven’t been able to get pregnant since. After my D&amp;C I ended up hospitalized for 2 weeks with excruciating pain, but they never found anything wrong, and all my tests came back normal. We’ve been seeing a naturopath for about a year, trying acupuncture and holistic methods until we could get into a fertility clinic. Due to covid our fertility appointment kept getting pushed back and were just finally getting tests done this month. By the end of next week I’ll have all new bloodwork done, a sonohysterogram and my husbands SA will be done... so hopefully we’ll have some news. I honestly don’t care if it’s good or bad, I just want more information so that we can make a plan. 

I know I should be feeling excited and hopeful that things are moving forward, but I feel more down this month than I have ever felt. Our closest friends who got pregnant at the same time as us in 2018, and now have a perfect baby boy, just announced that they’re expecting twins in March and I don’t want to get out of bed. 

I’m so sick of peeing on sticks and having scheduled sex, and going through this monthly rollercoaster ride.   Had no idea how alienating this process could be. I don’t want to be this person that can only talk about having a baby, and plans every little detail around the possibility of being pregnant or having a baby. But here I am. All consumed and exhausted. 

Does anyone else feel like trying for so long has changed you for good? Like maybe the excited, optimistic person you were in your first cycle is just totally gone? So hoping that when we finally get pregnant again and get out of the first trimester, that I’ll be able to feel hopeful and giddy."

However, I don't know how to distinguish that and a normal tissue passing. I get lumps sometimes or bigger drops of blood because there's more tissue. Is that consider blood clot? I google period blood clot and they are huge and mine isn't that big and sort of falls out of shape when hitting the toilet water."
732,today went shop attempt feel littl better get period friday month especi hard sinc found sister got pregnant second child alreadi godmoth first one moon get godmoth second one well tough tri cope fact yet pregnant month anyway husband look men depart sneak babi depart cri littl went cute littl babi thing broke heart littl wipe away tear went back hubbi best enjoy rest day amaz lucki wife mix feel say least,1,0,"Today I went shopping in an attempt to feel a little better after getting my period on Friday. This month is especially hard since I just found out my sister got pregnant with her second child. I am already godmother for their first one and am over the moon that I get to be godmother for their second one as well. But it’s tough, too. We are trying to cope with the fact that we are yet again not pregnant this month. 

Anyway, while my husband was looking in the men’s department, I sneaked out to the baby department and cried a little as I went through all of the cute little baby things. It broke my heart a little. Then I wiped away the tears and went back to my hubby and did my best to enjoy the rest of the day. He’s amazing and I am so lucky to be his wife. 

Mixed feelings, to say the least!"
743,need get head hub sa begin august first appoint fertil clinic today blood scan talk nurs afterward say noth untoward scan go back cd blood said sa result back sperm arent move could tell us realli next step androlog clinic right feel hopeless could honestli cri let nurs told lay protein drink time dabbl steroid past think caus part feel resent almost feel guilti feel way hope know near futur keep everyth cross someth fix actual point post need divulg,1,0,"Just needing to get this out of my head.

Hub had SA at the beginning of August. We had first appointment in fertility clinic today. Bloods and scan for me.

Talking to the nurse afterwards and she says nothing was untoward on my scan. I'm to go back on cd21 for bloods. We said we hadn't had SA results back and if she had them. 

He only has a few sperm in it and they arent moving. 

That's all she could tell us really. Next step is the Andrology clinic but right now I'm feeling very hopeless and could honestly cry if I let myself. 

The nurse told him to lay off the protein drinks, which he has all the time. He has dabbled with steroids in the past and I think this is what has caused this and part of me feels resentful almost, and then I feel guilty for feeling this way.

Hopefully will know more in the near future and I'm keeping everything crossed that it is something that can  be fixed. No actual point to this post I just needed to divulge."

839,hi came bc june withdraw bleed think bleed week point thought pregnant period day long light think use tampon rest spot long later around week light buy pad first time year wear tampon felt dri uncomfi get ewcm week bleed anyon els odd experi like come bc,1,0,"Hi, I came off BC in June, I had no withdrawal bleed I don’t think, I had no bleeding at all for 6 weeks, to the point I thought I was pregnant, I then had a period of only 2 days long, very light, think I used 2 tampons and the rest was spotting.
Not too long later, around 3 weeks, I had the same again, very light, had to buy pads for the first time in over 20 years, as I just couldn’t wear a tampon, I felt too dry and uncomfy. I did get EWCM a week or so before both bleeds.
Has anyone else had odd experiences like this coming off BC?"
