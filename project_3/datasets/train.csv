We have [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/wiki/rules) we expect all community members will follow. Posts and comments that do not follow these rules will be removed by the mod team. If you see something that is breaking one of these rules, please use the report button or [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTryingForABaby). The major community-specific rules are detailed below.

* **No BFPs (big fat positives; i.e., positive pregnancy results) or other comments about ongoing pregnancies outside the weekly thread.** TFAB is for talking about trying to get pregnant, and when you get a positive test, you've graduated! We love when community members get pregnant, and we ask that you post your about your positive test in the weekly stickied BFP thread only. In threads/comments other than the weekly thread, do not mention your ongoing pregnancy and do not link to your posts about it in other subs. This rule extends to both posts and comments, and includes any positive result, even if it's faint, and any ongoing pregnancy.

* **No posts asking other users to tell their success stories.** If you want to create a post asking specifically for success stories (*e.g.*, ""Has anyone else experienced this weird thing and then gotten a BFP?"" ""How long did it take you to conceive after this situation?""), please do so over on a pregnancy sub. These posts are soliciting stories that break the ""no positive pregnancy tests outside the weekly thread"" rule above. This includes asking for a follow up from a user who is planning to test soon. 

* **No ""am I pregnant?"" posts.** Do not ask the community if you're pregnant, either in direct or roundabout ways. No one, including your doctor, can tell you whether you're pregnant or not based off symptoms and/or charts -- no single symptom or group of symptoms is a guarantee that you are pregnant. If you think you're pregnant, you need to take a pregnancy test. If you just want to get it out, though, /r/amipregnant is a great place to ask these questions.

* **Don't ""bingo"" other users.** Don't suggest unhelpful cliches to others that belong on a TTC bingo card: ""just relax"", ""never give up, mama!"", ""why not adopt?"", ""my cousin's dogsitter's sister was about to do IVF but then got magically pregnant,"" etc. These are ""bingos"" because people who are TTC hear them all the time, and they are more hurtful than helpful. For further explanation, check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/d878k2/new_rule_no_bingos_examples_and_explanations/)!

* **Please be kind and think about the words you use.** Trying to conceive is an emotional topic and we want to respect others' opinions and views, even if they may be different than yours. There's no one right way to go about TTC, and we have users here at all stages of the process and with all family configurations. This is a safe and supportive community for all people TTC.

1,TryingForABaby,"Congratulations on starting a new journey post-TTC! Before you move on to pregnancy subs, please share your cycle information and celebrate with us.

If a specific user has been especially helpful to you during your time TTC, or that you've become friends with, that's fantastic! However, we do ask that you **refrain from tagging other users in your BFP post**. This is to be sensitive and respectful to the thoughts and feelings of others - we keep this thread separate so that people can view it as they wish and can handle doing so. You can definitely thank people, just don't tag them to the thread!",t3_ink9rd
2,TryingForABaby,"I know that depo didn't like you, so you went away whilst he was around. I know you held a grudge because he's been gone 6 months and there has been no sign of you.

Last week OPK told me you were coming, but I didn't know you would be here so soon and make such a scene!

 I'm happy you are back, I am (for now atleast, because as soon as possible the room will be a nursery) but CALM.DOWN!",t3_iq0qw4
3,TryingForABaby,"I legitimately don’t understand how people can NTNP. It just feels very black and white to me. You are either trying or avoiding. There is no in between.

I’m only 3 cycles into TTC and I have zero chill. I’m 32 years old and probably a certifiable crazy person. 

I’ve got 6 years of cycle data in my Clue app. FAM has been my primary birth control for around 9 years. Since I’ve been acutely aware of my cycle periods for so long I cannot conceive of just not knowing when I was fertile. 

I’ve been charting ovulation with OPKs for a year because my cycle got a little messed up after major weight loss. Those little sticks just made me greedy to gather even more data. Plus, i bought the giant box from Amazon so I figured i might as well use them. I broke down and bought a Tempdrop when we officially started trying because I wasn’t fully confident in my manual BBT skills. I’m a neurotic mess who overprepares for everything so I’m not sure why I thought trying to have a baby would be different. 

I’m trying to imagine a world where I was chill enough to NTNP. I’m trying to imagine a world where I wasn’t hyper aware of my cycle so that I could just “let it happen” I feel like these people are on another level of existence. Damn, I wish I could be one of them.",t3_iq98qu
4,TryingForABaby,"Just a quick lament.. why, just why, does it seem like all my contacts on Facebook have babies? I know I have to be patient and not stress but, ugh! Such a sting when I see everyone and their baby.",t3_iqb0sg
5,TryingForABaby,"I’ve posted once before about the confusing information I was receiving from the fertility clinic about my AMH level, and the panic the clinic was giving me over my clock “running out”. For reference, I’m 32 years old and have been trying with my boyfriend for 3 years to get pregnant. 

I wasn’t being given any reason as to why I wasn’t getting pregnant, and I was beyond frustrated. The clinic was unprofessional and the doctor had clearly not remembered us from our previous appointments. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money pursuing IUI, like the clinic was pushing, if I didn’t understand what the underlying problem was, and without addressing it first. I didn’t even understand how IUI was the solution for me? This frustration combined with 8 pregnant friends at the same time, I was becoming depressed. 

I finally went and saw my naturopath, who helped me in the past significantly with an unrelated health concern. Through blood work she picked up borderline hypothyroidism, through monitoring she noticed it was getting worse. I’m just at the point now where we’re going to try to address it with natural supplements, and if that doesn’t work speak with a doctor about Synthroid. 

I am just finally feeling like I have a direction to work towards, and the relief this has provided me is amazing. I can stand to be around my friends again and I don’t feel any resentment anymore. Apparently my memory and energy should improve. I’m feeling very hopeful and I just wanted to share this experience with others feeling the same frustration that I was! I’m lucky that my benefits helped me to explore the naturopathic option, and I recommend it to anyone who’s able to!",t3_iq6bcj
6,TryingForABaby,"Yooo!! Long time lurker, first time poster, generally totally clueless to all things TFAB.

I’m 37, just got married to my 40 year old husband. Neither of us have ever been married before and we don’t have any kids, either with each other or anyone else!

(Side note: Neither of us “look” like we are our age. It’s not unusual for cashiers to ask us if we are students or where we go to college when we’re out and about. I don’t think I’ve ever, in my whole life, not been IDed, and I don’t think anyone has ever *not* expressed pure and utter shock when they see I’m 37 on my ID.

I bring this up because I asked my gyno: “Well if I look like I’m 24, doesn’t that mean my ovaries look like they are 24, too?”

And she laughed and gave me a resounding “NO” and said my ovaries are 37, end of story, and I might not look geriatric, but I’m geriatric.)

Anyways.

We got married and now we’re like “yay, babies!” I’m not sure if we can technically be called TFAB because we’re not really *trying* anything, we just stopped using condoms and BD whenever we feel like it. (I’ve been lurking because I know there’s a huge chance that, since I’m old as dirt, this isn’t going to be easy.)

That said, I have no idea how many DPO I am, but I’m on day 32 of my cycle which is usually 28 days. I’m too nervous to POAS, so right now I’m just holding on to “well, AF hasn’t showed up yet, sooooo..... maybe?”

I’m mostly posting this so you guys can chuckle at my naivety in a few days when I edit this post and let y’all know AF arrived.

But for now..... we hope, right?? 

Signed,

Old lady who looks quite young but still has geriatric ovaries and is sort of TFAB and hoping for the best.",t3_ipvwia
7,TryingForABaby,"And I had hoped that after my IUI near the end of August, I have a BFP as a present for my wife today.

Instead, I'm starting Clomid tonight and hoping for a BFP before my birthday next month. I'm tired of the disappointment, of the tests, of having nurses and doctors all up in my business, all to have no clear answer on why there hasn't been success. 

It's like being stuck in a rut, and I'm tired from trying to dig my way out. 

I have had about 4 glasses of wine in the last three months b/c TTC. Well, tonight I'm having champagne and making the night about the incredible support my wife has given me. I'm putting these feelings out here to you all, so that I can put them aside and focus on her today.",t3_iq3t6j
8,TryingForABaby,"Hi lovelies. My husband and I just recently began TTC. The big P just rolled around, and now I’m bummed out and disappointed. What are some ways that make you feel better or help you get through the letdown?",t3_iq6gm5
9,TryingForABaby,"I posted not too long ago just asking if people like to test early, or wait until their missed period/other symptoms.

Well, as of today my period is 3 days late.  I am on Cycle 3 after stopping the pill.  My first natural period on Cycle 2 was right on schedule, after a 28 day cycle (which is what it was like when I was on the pill).

I know it's possible that my body is still adjusting and this cycle could just be longer, but I am 13DPO (based on my app, I don't know if my ovulation day is perfectly accurate) so I am planning on taking a test tonight.

I am so excited but also soo nervous!  The anticipation is killing me haha... I bought the tests last night and was tempted to do it then, but thought I'd give myself one more day just to see.  Still nothing, so I am testing tonight.  I want my SO to be there to see the results with me, so I have to wait until he gets home from work later.

My anxiety is driving me crazy right now, I don't know what to do to take my mind off of it until later!  Ahh!",t3_iqayph
10,TryingForABaby,I am 28f and husband is 32m. We have been ttc since June 2019. When we hit the year mark I called my gp and she wasn’t really much help. Just told me that they wouldn’t refer till we had been trying for two years and to just keep having sex every 2 to 3 days and most couples conceive by then. I came away feeling deflated and frustrated. Is it normal to have to wait two years before the doctor will do anything?,t3_iqavtm
11,TryingForABaby,"Sorry for formatting as well, im on mobile

Has anyone else gone through moments like, ""Wait am I/are we ready for a baby?"" 

Or had moments where you get super nervous about pregnancy symptoms so you stop trying that month but then the next month you're trying again?

Anyone else like this? My SO thinks its normal but I dont know.",t3_iq25nm

13,TryingForABaby,"I've been exhausted the last few days, and always hungry. I'm CD19, believed that I may have O'd on CD14 (the test was dark, but not sure if it was as dark as the control line). So now I'm all jazzed up that these are symptoms and this is happening and.... I am not a patient woman. lol. That's always been my downfall.

Anyone else in a similar boat? Feel free to vent here, too!",t3_iq67u4
14,TryingForABaby,"Just received results of a 7dpo progesterone test and while it shows I’m ovulating (10ng/ml or 32 nmol), the results seem pretty borderline. I believe 10ng/ml is the threshold for ovulation, and while I know progesterone levels can fluctuate, any idea if this is an issue for conception? My PMS seems to have lessened a lot since a miscarriage in May so I’m concerned about low hormones. 

I should note that I never spot during my cycles and while my LP was short immediately after the MC, it has lengthened to 11 days and at its longest it was 12 days. 

Any insight into whether supplementation would be helpful?",t3_iqc78o
15,TryingForABaby,"Has anyone else found their period coming early since they start ttc? 
So frickin rude, you’re all excited to take a test, maybe wait till 11 or 12DPO so you should definitely be able to see the line, and then bam, Aunt Flo comes 3 days early again.",t3_iq3lep

19,TryingForABaby,"Hi! I posted about this in the daily chat but no one responded so here I am. I have been getting some tests done recently to try and get to the bottom of what might be causing my long cycles. 

To rule out PCOS my doctor said if I want to I can elect to have an ultrasound (transvag and abdominal).  But he didn’t say whether I should or shouldn’t do it and left the Choice up to me. I am wondering how necessary this really is if all of my labs and my physical exam were normal and were not indicative of PCOS. 

Has anyone here had normal labs , normal physical exam but upon ultrasound exam it was confirmed that you have PCOS? Part of me does want to get the ultrasound just to make sure everything is okay in there. It would also be a cycle day 3 ultrasound if that makes a difference.",t3_iqa8m4
20,TryingForABaby,"Are you trying to conceive baby number 2/3/n+1? Have questions about TTC while breastfeeding, or bedsharing, or just being plain exhausted? This is your place!",t3_iq53n1
21,TryingForABaby,"I'll leave my background information related to actually getting the test below. 

However, it probably is relevant that I went into this test with my left arm taped up for nerve pain from the phlebotomist hitting my radial nerve during my blood draw for my D3 tests.  Medical procedures typically don't bother me, but my confidence in medical professionals was not exactly at an all time high with my numb/pain shooting arm from a standard procedure.

I took my 800 mg of ibuprofen one hour before the procedure, and my husband took the day off of work to come along. I was expecting to be traumatized, so we had plans for all of the pies and Indian food he was meant to cook for me afterwards on top of getting ice cream. 

We ended up going through three different buildings at the hospital before ending up in the right place. I expected this after my husband had to do a similar, but much larger loop trying to find the lab for the semen analysis, so we were still early. My Ob/Gyn just moved into a brand new building in the hospital, so this was expected. Because I had called my PCP earlier in the day for an appointment for my arm, I discovered that my test was scheduled an hour earlier than I thought, and I wasn't nearly as phased when the first hospital location told me that I didn't have an appointment.  

A nurse brought me back before my scheduled appointment time and explained that she would be there to help me. She also explained the procedure and all of the people who would participate. She had a student following her, as well. I  hadn't realized that my Ob would actually be doing the exam,  so that was a nice surprise.  The nurse put a chair for my husband by my head and also gave him a lead apron.

She explained each step to me, but I still barely noticed any of them. I anticipated that it was going to be a rather uneventful procedure when she told me to expect a cold or scratching feeling when she cleaned my cervix, as I was barely able to even notice it. If she hadn't mentioned it, I don't think I would have noticed. I explained much of this to my husband while it was happening. ""No, I'm not suffering yet.""

She did warn me that the catheter would be worse and that I should also expect the dye to feel uncomfortable. Once again, I think that I was able to identify this feeling only because she warned me in advance. I'm not 100% sure when it went in. At this point I started making jokes to my husband about how I was in so much pain and was definitely going to need all of that food we planned on. Somewhere amidst these jokes, the dye was injected.  I was warned about it, so I did notice the tiniest bit of cramping after a while. I was still preparing myself for the upcoming painful part when she told me that it was done. She did say that she was surprised by how little I reacted and that most people do ask when it's going to be over.  

My husband apparently hasn't thought that they put the catheter in yet, because I hadn't reacted.  It does seem like I had a bit of an outlier of a nearly painless experience, but I hadn't thought it was really possible for it to be that comfortable. They didn't make me turn to either side, and that probably helped. 

I only wish my period cramps were this mild.  This was a 1/10 compared to a standard cramp.  The cramps that I get from eating overly processed foods or pizza are several times worse than this.  I'm sure that 800 mg of ibuprofen also helped. 

I was told that everything looked normal before I even left the table, so there was also no wait on that. 

Also,  they had a separate bathroom attached with towels and a pad for me. They left me alone to clean up and told me to take as much time as I needed.  I used one of my own  washable pads, since I prefer cotton, but it was way more than what I needed.  Most of the liquid came out when they removed everything else, so there wasn't much left for the pad.

I just wanted to share another positive experience, as I read many of these before my visit.  

Even though my experience was positive, I think it helped having my husband there, since I had something else to focus on. I was very relieved afterwards, and we skipped all of my plans for lying around eating ice cream etc. I stopped for a Frappuccino and a cake pop instead, and I felt pretty much normal for the rest of the day. If my arm was normal, I would have felt fine going to the gym. 

Background:
We started in August of 2019, but my cycles are pretty short and regular, so we're probably on 14 or 15. I stopped counting, as it just created stress that I wouldn't otherwise have. 

I scheduled an appointment a bit after the 1 year mark after my wedding. I originally needed to wait a month, but they called me and moved the appointment up two weeks. The OB didn't really take my Modern Fertility (which were normal) results that seriously, but she did skip straight to scheduling an HSG and sending my husband for a semen analysis. She mentioned that I would probably need the new blood tests for insurance, and I didn't have any issue with that, since I did the other test almost a year ago. 

Also, I noticed afterwards that my insurance wants pre-approval for infertility procedures, but they do provide quite a bit of coverage. That might be something to look into if you're reading HSG results ahead of time like I was. (Edit: While this is true for some procedures, they said that HSG actually didn't require pre-approval and my doctor notify us of anything that does. Some small print apparently existss omewhere explaining this.)

Lastly, I suspect that part of the reason that I dealt with the procedure so well is that it wasn't a very mentally difficult procedure for me. Most of the women on one side of my family don't have biological children, and several adopted, so I was used to the idea that it was normal long before I ever considered it for myself.",t3_iq3n4f

23,TryingForABaby,"Hello! I got my Paraguard removed on 8/18, and have consistently used the Flo app to predict my period. My cycle is very regular and will come between CD26-28. However, since getting it removed, my period is late. I am also using the Glow app and it is saying that my period will be tomorrow. I have no symptoms or signs of my period coming, and those are almost always regular. 

I was wondering if anyone else had any issues with Paraguard removal causing period irregularity? 

Also, I have been testing everyday for the past week and they have all been BFN. I am currently on CD30.",t3_iq7e70
24,TryingForABaby,Has anyone (males) gone through their sperm not being viable and potentially having to go through a Soren donor? It is difficult for me to consider even as it’s hard to think of as “your” child. That as well as it being very emasculating it is hard to think about,t3_iq6msh
25,TryingForABaby,"Hi, I’m new. I’m on my first cycle TTC.

I’ve been tracking my TC ratio and LH level. My app has been telling me my ‘peak’ is CD15, but the tests keeps showing me low levels.

I started feeling cramps around my lower left side last night, CD 17, and tested today. The tests, for the first time, show the dark line! Do these cramps mean I’m ovulating? Should we try tonight or tomorrow?",t3_iqb5u4
26,TryingForABaby,"A little background: My husband (23M) and I (23F) have been off of HBC for over a year and we recently stopped using condoms back in July. Growing up I never wanted kids, and it's only been in the last 6 months that I've really worked through some of my issues and come to be okay with the idea.

 We figured that since we have sex 1-2 times a week we would inevitably catch my fertile window without having to actively track and try. But after some blood work and tests we have found out it will probably be more difficult for us to have kids.  I know my husband and I are relatively young still, but I'm worried that if we put off actively trying, we will miss our opportunity to actually have kids. But I don't know if I'm ready for the level of stress that comes with TTC when we have fertility issues (tracking temperatures every day, bills, all the doctor visits, OPKs, pills, etc. etc. etc.)

I love the stage of life we are in. We both work at jobs we love, are building a house, travelling, and overall enjoying our life being just us two. I don't know if I am ready to leave that yet (I mean I wouldn't be heartbroken if we got pregnant now, hence NTNP). But again, I'm worried that since getting pregnant won't be super easy for us, that we have to start the super stressful process now.

Has anyone else been in this situation? Any advice?",t3_iqahcf

28,TryingForABaby,I’m 9DPO and having sex hurts. I had cramps during and after sex. It feels like AF cramps but much more directed on one side.

Is it something about the cervix position?,t3_iqa6ig
29,TryingForABaby,"Hi everyone! I recently posted about my OB/GYN telling me I needed to lose weight in order to conceive. Although I wasn’t happy about the way he went about it, it’s actually pushed me to start making some small changes. 
I’ve decided to cut out all soda, coffee, and iced tea and drink only water. This is a struggle for me because I’m not a huge water lover, but I’m hoping this will keep me full and flush out my body. 
My friends and I are going to do a “weight loss challenge” September 21st and all put in 20 dollars. Whoever loses the most weight gets all the money.
Im nervous because I really have never lost weight in my life and they all have in the past. 
Just wondering if there’s any tips or suggestions anyone has. I know this is more a post for weight loss but as much as I’ve wanted to lose weight in the past, my main motivator is getting pregnant. 
I’m truly hopeful that just making some small changes in what I eat and drink and how much exercise I get will help me drop about 20 pounds (to start)!",t3_ipqq31
30,TryingForABaby,"Hey all, my partner and I are in our second cycle of TTC. In our first cycle, we have had already been temping for a few months and had a confirmed ovulation on CD14. My partner's cycle for the past several months has been 28, 27, and 27 days. She had all of the pregnancy symptoms without having the cramping she usually gets before her period during the TWW. Her period arrived 4 days late and was uncharacteristically heavy. Based on this, her luteal phase was 18 days when it is normally 13-14 days. All of this seemed kind of weird and I'm wondering what might have been going on. Any ideas?

I know we hit o2 and o5 but even I know that isn't good enough most times and then i get sad and upset and start crying because i feel like we already missed out before we even had a chance. And if she even does anything tonight it'll be after 2am which the surge will already be gone by then and it'll be too late. Does anyone else struggle with this?",t3_iq7t2t
33,TryingForABaby,"Hey hey! I am feeling extra discouraged this month but trying to be proactive. Some of the podcasts I listen to do advertisements for Modern Fertility and I have done a little bit of research but am hesitant to waste my money on something, so I figured I would throw these questions out here to anyone in this group who has used an at home fertility test: 
Did you feel like it was worth the money? 
Do you feel more informed about yourself and your cycle/have a better peace of mind? 
Have you also done fertility tests at a doctors office/ how does it compare?

40,TryingForABaby,"TW: Loss

Hi all, I'm feeling brave enough to post in here today, although I mainly frequent r/ttcafterloss (please do check this sub out if you weren't aware of it and have experienced a loss of any sort).

Anyway, I was 'lucky' enough to fall pregnant back in February after just three cycles/months TTC, but had a MMC back in April.  We started trying again as soon as it was safe to after the surgery and so far nothing.  Today marks a week into cycle 6 post-loss.  This month (September) is the last time we can try until December, so if it doesn't stick this time, then essentially we will be at the 1 year mark from when we started this journey in 2019 before we can try again, which is a really depressing thought.

Although I'm trying to stay positive, and know that it taking up to a year of actively trying is completely normal, I won't deny that it feels more and more disheartening each month that passes.  Having had surgery to resolve the MC, there is also the lingering worry that something has happened to me as a result of that which means I've screwed my chances of ever being able to get pregnant again.

Anyway, I have a few consultations booked from next week discussing various options, so if we don't get it this cycle, then I'm hoping I can at least use the next two months to have some blood tests, initial explorations etc that will help the time pass and give me some reassurance that all is well.

What are everyone's plans who are at this mile marker or beyond?  How are you feeling today?",t3_ipxw7l
41,TryingForABaby,"I got my mirena out on Friday of last week after about a year of having it. I started spotting on Saturday and haven't stopped. I'm tracking, so I know I haven't ovulated, but the spotting has occasionally gone into light bleeding territory and I don't want to chart that and reset my cycle if I might still ovulate. Should I just keep tracking as one longer cycle until I ovulate / get another period of bleeding?

My OB said I could ovulate the next day if I was still ovulating, or after a week or so. But it also might take a month or two to work out my cycles. So I know it's variable. Maybe I just answered my own question 🤔",t3_iq5swo

43,TryingForABaby,"So DH and I recently made the choice to start trying (I'm 30, he's 31), it was kind of a bad time right then but the time has come!

All fun and games..

The only problem is, Ive had some little niggling thoughts. Prior to being on HBC pill I had an IUD (Mirena I think), I got terrible ovarian cysts that caused a lot of pain, I also got terrible acne, it was for these reasons that I had my IUD removed and changed to HBC pill. At the time my doctor made an offhand comment about having problems with testosterone. I never had hormone levels tested or anything like that but now that we're trying these two things have been bouncing around in my brain and I've gone and convinced myself Ive got PCOS (what a drama queen I know!).

48,TryingForABaby,"I'm going off HBC soon and we won't be using condoms. We have a very infrequent sex life, usually like once a month, so I really don't think it will be difficult to avoid getting pregnant for 6 months as long as I'm tracking with OPKs and BBT, and using pullout method when we do have sex.

My question is, how exactly should I used this data to PREVENT pregnancy? I have a general idea of how to use it to get pregnant, but I've never seen exactly when you should AVOID sex if you're trying to prevent. 

Is it just 3 days before and after ovulation? A full week before and after? The full week before and a few days after? 

We don't have period sex, so that whole week is out, so I'm concerned that eliminating a week or two on top of period week is going to make it tricky to know eventually when it's safe to have sex without risking pregnancy. 

I'm also pretty willing to skip PIV sex for 6 months and just be intimate through other means (oral &amp; manual) to satisfy our very low sexual needs if the risk of accidental pregnancy is higher than I think. 

It wouldn't be awful but would be very annoying to get pregnant before we plan to, since our TTC date is also our wedding. I'd love to fit into my expensive dress and not have the added complication of pregnancy at, and leading up to, my wedding.",t3_iq6jgz

During my most recent doctor’s visit, they also did an ultrasound to check how everything was “looking.” It turns out I have cysts on both ovaries but I was told this could OR could not be PCOS.

I started my OPK testing on Day 5, I had low LH levels up until CD 11, where I received my first high 0.5, it then just got higher and higher with the Premom app saying I had a peak on CD 14 at 1.76. I continued to recheck the following days until CD 16 and they are low again....so my question is.....did I ovulate on CD14? Or did I actually Ovulate on CD 15? Because I had the LH Surge on CD 14....this is where it gets all confusing for me...and also, is 1.76 even high enough??? Been reading online it says LH surge should be like double digits or so.

73,TryingForABaby,"Hello everyone. First of all, english is not my first language and my wife does all the researching on the pregnancy subject, so excuse me for not knowing all the medical terms. I am making this post because we've been having problems trying to get pregnant and it is really taking a toll on her with feelings of depression. Conventional doctors are rarely much help as they never seem to be willing do actually do some exams and dig for the issue and just repeat to keep trying. And we can't afford actually great doctors. Basic information: I'm 29, eat extremely healthy, exercise, no health issues, etc., she's 32, eats healthy too and exercises, but her family has a history of autoimmune diseases like lupus, altough she doesn't seem to have anything serious, except  subclinical hypothyroidism.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we have been trying for 9 months and, and I know it hasn't been one year, but there is definitely something going on here. Fertilization occurred 3 times already, with pharmacy hCG tests showing pregnancy, and confirmed by blood hCG, and she really has a great sensitivity about her body changes, and she notices all the things that happens when someone is pregnant. On all 3 times, hCG doesn't increase much and implementation is what has failed, and every time, the only sympton she has had so far is intense itching all over her body and it starts the moment she feels that implementation has failed, her breasts lose swelling, basal temperature drops, dysmenorrhea, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I know aneuploidy can lead to miscarriages, but the whole itching thing is what is making us very suspicious that it could be something else. She spends most of her nights doing research, and lately we have been suspicious of being something related to auto-immunity, progesterone, and related issues. I would just like to ask you if anyone has any idea or direction to point us to, I feel powerless in wanting to help her without knowing what to do, and, like I said, this whole thing has been really bad for her depression.",t3_ipm1ya

I took 5mg letrozole CD3-7 and had a positive OPK CD 15 and 18. Today which should be CD 26 I noticed bleeding.

I didnt get a couple days of notice like u normally would with OPKs. Should we BD today or is it too late??

I had an idea tonight &amp; I wanted some opinions/thoughts! (None of my friends/sisters have had babies/been pregnant &amp; we were all the results of “wonderful oopsies” as my mother likes to call it, so don’t feel like she would understand!) 

Has anyone looked into or successfully done monthly self examinations of their cervix to check/confirm ovulation? I was reading this website https://www.beautifulcervix.com/see-your-own-beautiful-cervix/ as I was trying to understand what my cervix feels like at different stages of my cycle, when I saw they offer a kit for the DIY/curious individual! 

(For anyone needing clarification - a self examination is when you use a speculum, a hand mirror &amp; a torch which allows you to see straight into your cervix, seeing if it’s open, closed etc etc) 


I was thinking if done safely &amp; correctly (I.e not doing it if it was too uncomfortable) - doing it one or twice a month after receiving a positive OPK, would help confirm 100% that I am ovulating! 

I am only able to OPK test as I am a shift worker with a horrible sleeping pattern so I know I would forget to BBT test every morning! So just trying to come up with another way to confirm the OPK tests aside from symptoms &amp; EWCM :) 

P.s TMI - I understand Pap smears generally are meant to be uncomfortable and not everyone’s cup of tea! but I have never had an issue with them, we use toys regularly in the bedroom so I don’t think pain or being uncomfortable would be an issue after the initial fumble around trying to complete the task myself! :)

But My husband's semen analysis shows he's got great motility, great sperm count, but only 2% of his sperm are the right shape for fertilisation(apparently they only need 4%+ to be normal for normal fertilityl).

He is getting re-tested in 4-6 weeks to make sure that this isn't a one off freak result. 

Apparently there is a 50/50 chance it'll come back fine next time. But if it comes back the same, or worse - we will 100% need IVF. He said anything under 4% essentially renders my husband infertile.

112,TryingForABaby,"Hi all! I wanted to take a moment (edit: or not, this ended up being a REALLY long post) to share my personal experience with SIS and HSG because I know up until I went for these tests myself, I literally read every single experience I could find on Reddit to help quell some of my anxiety. I combed every day looking for a fresh post. It seems experiences are wildly variable, so I just thought I’d add my 2 cents to the pot.

I started my TTC journey with my RE by scheduling my HSG at the hospital I work at for convenience. I read every single Reddit post I could about the HSG and was well aware of the test’s reputation. When I went, a nice rad tech asked me to take a pregnancy test (I tried to reason that I’m gay and was told “well you never know” ugh lol). I stripped from the waist down, signed my consent, and was laid down on a table with stirrups and a large x-ray machine above it. A radiology department PA came in and detailed what she’d be doing. I was very anxious at this point but felt confident that it’d be over soon. I thought wrong. She basically rammed the speculum and opened it to max all in one motion. I was in tears from this as I’ve never had any clinician be SO blatantly rough. She attempted multiple times to insert the catheter, which felt like a searing, pinching cramp and I also kept feeling a strange (but not painful) popping feeling. She sighed and said she couldn’t get the catheter in. She paged the radiologist, who told her to try using a dilator. I had a brief moment where I thought to object, but just really wanted to get it over with so I let her try. I’m fairly certain being stabbed in the vagina with a hot firepoker would have hurt less. I started screaming in pain. It was far and away the worst pain I have ever felt, so painful and mind numbing that I was reduced to total fight of flight mode trying to scramble away. I had to shriek for her to stop and almost fell off the X-day table. After she finally removed everything and looked at me with an incredulous “wow, really?” look, I just curled up into a ball on the table and sobbed. The radiologist suggested I must have cervical stenosis and I’d need to have this procedure under anesthesia. I trudged back to my office in the hospital with my head hanging low. I felt completely emotionally and physically violated. I’d never read a single post detailing a similar experience to mine and balked at the idea of ever going through that again.

I called my RE’s office when I got home. They told me I’d need to come in for a saline sonogram with my RE so he could see more what’s going on. At this point, I really didn’t mentally think I could do it, so I took a week off to catch my breath. The setup was very similar for the saline sonogram as the HSG, except it was done in an exam room on a regular exam table. I stripped from the waist down and waited for my RE. He was apologetic and ensured me there was likely nothing wrong with my cervix and that today would be nothing like my experience at the hospital. Unconvinced, I shakily laid down and jumped every time I was touched. This time, the speculum didn’t hurt at all. He started to make small talk with me and cracked a joke, and when I nervously laughed, he said, “guess what? The catheter is in!” I seriously did not feel a thing, which felt like the greatest blessing ever bestowed upon me after the complete horror I experienced at the hospital. He removed the speculum and then inserted the ultrasound probe which was mildly uncomfortable, but not particularly painful (exactly like a regular TVUS - having the catheter in with it did not hurt). Next, the saline was injected. I didn’t really expect this part to hurt, but unfortunately it did. For me the pain felt like very deep, undulating period cramps. It hurt for about a total of 60 seconds and seemed to worsen in intensity as the seconds passed. I was definitely grateful when it was done, but I wouldn’t say it was uncomfortable enough to make me cry. From start to finish the procedure took approximately 3 minutes, with only about 60 seconds of that being quite painful, although I did have some ongoing minor cramping for about 20 minutes after (and randomly later that evening?).

After my saline sonogram, my RE recommended I come back to try again for my HSG with them. I really, really, really did not want to do this, but my saline sonogram was not totally normal and there was some concern I may have a unicornuate uterus and he said we could rule that out if I happened to have 2 patent tubes on HSG. I finally relented and had my HSG this morning. The anxiety leading up to this procedure was 20x worse than the procedure itself. I laid on the X-ray table and tried not to cry. Again, there was no pain with speculum insertion. I did not feel the catheter either (despite apparently the HSG catheter being about double the size of the SIS catheter), but I DID feel the balloon inflation. I had heard that it causes a pinch, but in my experience, the balloon caused repeated undulating cramping very similar to the SIS. It feels like a superficial but moderately intense period cramp. I think I uttered a quick, “ow!” when it happened and then was surprised that it continued to hurt past the initial inflation. RE then injected the dye, which I knew is what most people have issues with. For me, the pain was only slightly more intense than it was with the SIS, although the type of pain was identical. I actually found that although the HSG pain was more intense, it didn’t last as long and stopped as soon as the procedure was done. I think I uttered a curse word at first and then decided to start taking big, long, dramatic breaths instead and that actually helped a lot. The catheter was removed without pain and then RE confirmed for me that I do not have a unicornuate uterus and both tubes are patent. All of the pain I felt during my infertility workup suddenly seemed so inconsequential. Afterwards, I wore a pad (suggest bringing a good one from home because you’ll need more than just a pantyliner) and went to Cheesecake Factory to reward myself!

My subjective pain assessment for SIS = 5/10; for HSG = 7/10, but much briefer than SIS.

Tl;dr: try to have your procedures done in your RE’s office instead of having them done somewhere more convenient. The experience level of the clinician performing these tests absolutely positively *DOES* matter (at least in my case) and having to come back for a redo completely sucks. These tests just suck in general and carry an emotional weight with them that I did not expect. There’s nothing worse than lying on that stupid table in the most vulnerable position there is, not knowing whether you’ll feel nothing or if you’ll be completely brutalized. Still, more likely than not, you will be greatly uncomfortable for less than a minute and then it’ll be over. I can’t overstate enough how important it is to treat yourself afterward! I hope my account helps anyone out there about to have these tests find a shred of comfort about what’s to come!",t3_ip2cv5

In March, I had a CT for colitis which incidentally showed a 2.6x1.8cm dermoid on my left ovary. My GYN presented surgery or watchful waiting. I’ve had two follow up scans that have shown no growth, I’ve had no pain.

I came off the pill in May with the intentions of TTC. I conceived my first child within 3 months off the pill, I did not experience irregular cycles, and I got positive OPKs on Clearblue. 

This time, I’ve had irregular cycles (30-45 days) and I’ve not had a positive OPK- although I’ve been struggling trying to use Easy @ Homes. My doc has offered an ovulation drug if this persists when I visit in October. 

Are dermoids and infertility related? We have never spent much time talking about the cyst since it hasn’t grown and I don’t have pain- plus Covid keeps appointments brief. Can they affect ovulation? Is surgery necessary? I’m getting mixed info online and was hoping to get anecdotal information from other women in a similar situation.",t3_ip6snr

It makes me more annoyed when it’s people who have had kids and want to have more and think it all happens magically. I usually hear the rage inducing “you just have to have sex!” Oh really? Is that why I’ve spent months temping, taking OPKs, timing sex just perfectly, and reading about every single other factor that has to do with TTC?

121,TryingForABaby,"Is that safe for the fetus if you find out you are pregnant while you are experiencing recurrent outbreaks? 

I am aware of the dangers of experiencing the first outbreak while pregnant and also having outbreak during labor. But how about when you conceive? 

The virus is obviously in your body with the outbreaks are noticeable, tingling, burning or lesions, etc. Is that going to prevent or harm fertilization progress, implementation or fetus development?

I think I had my first outbreak maybe 5 years ago which then I didn't know it was herpes. I never thought I would get STI as I was always in a monogamous relationship. Now looking back, I wish I had checked for STI yearly. I am assuming I got it from last ex because that's when I got the first outbreak and found out he cheated on me multiple times after we broke up (I had suspicion but didn't know for sure and stupid of me, I believed him). 

I am not getting pregnant this cycle but still stressed, anxious, nervous and devastrated about the whole situation. I have OBGYN appointment in 2 weeks and would let her know of my concerns but it seems so far away from now.

I had my first high LH test reading on the 6th, it was then slightly higher on the 7th, and today it was back down again. What does this mean? Did I likely ovulate yesterday? Today?

129,TryingForABaby,"I went to my gyno a couple months back. I told her my husband and I are trying, and she said I could start prenatal pills. So I purchased [One-A-Day Women's Prenatal Gummies](https://www.oneaday.com/vitamins/prenatal-pregnancy-vitamins/prenatal-gummy-vitamins/) which don't have iron. (When I was a teenager, I had anemia, so my doctor suggested I take iron pills. The iron pills made me super constipated, so I knew to avoid the iron when looking for prenatal pills.) 

Well, regardless of finding pills that don't have iron, I am SUPER constipated. I used to pass normal bowel movements everyday like clockwork. Now I pass very little. I also suddenly gained 4lbs since taking them. (I've been 118lbs for the past 5 years, and I haven't changed my diet or workout habits at all.) So I'm assuming this is directly related to the constipation issues I'm having.

I just went off oral contraceptives 6 weeks ago after being on the same dosage since I was 18 (I'm 32), and I haven't gotten a period.

I know this is ""normal"" to take awhile for your body to regulate and friends have suggested taking ovulation tests, but with a totally out of sync cycle, how do I even know when to check if I am ovulating, or for that matter, when to take a pregnancy test?

135,TryingForABaby,"This is probably not a commonly shared thought in this thread but I wasn't sure where to post.

I've always wanted kids in general, but the thought of how difficult raising kids can be always made me question it. My husband feels the same way. We finally bought a house last year, and decided to come off the fence and try. I always thought having kids would be our choice but 10 months later it's been a slap in the face to find I have zero control over my own body. We have decided that we will be content either way, but I wish I knew which answer it'll be. I miss being innocent/ignorant to the situation and thinking that getting pregnant would be the one thing I wouldn't have to analyze and agonize over. I feel like any excitement or element of surprise has been stolen. If we can't have kids, at least we tried I guess? But how will I ever stop being obsessed with my cycle or go back to thinking my body isn't a failure?

It's been a weird day of thoughts today. Woke up to my second month of spotting a week before my period is due and I'm 90% sure I'm out for this month. I was feeling pretty frustrated. Then I went on reddit and a post about kids with severe behavioral issues came up and I reverted to all my fencesitter fears. What a rollercoaster. I kinda just want to move to a cabin and hide from all of my unicorn friends with perfect babies lol. I hate being in limbo and having to constantly think about this every single day.

136,TryingForABaby,"Hello! I came across this thread when I was trying to search reddit to see if anyone had insight into this issue. 

Essentially, as I said in the title, this is my first month TTC (really, yesterday was my first day). I bought the ClearBlue Advanced Digital Ovulation Kit. I am not doing anything with temperature yet since I'm literally just starting to try.

Typically, I have a 27-29 day cycle. Per recommendation from CB, I took my first test on CD8. I got an empty circle (not fertile). I then took it yesterday (CD9) and got a Peak Fertility circle. I'm really confused. Per my app tracker (and my normal cycle), I shouldn't be Peak Fertile or ovulating until Friday/Saturday. 

Has anyone had this experience? Especially going from not fertile one day to peak fertile the next? Is it possible I'm ovulating early? If so, is that something I should be concerned about?",t3_ioukhi

The app, though controversial with data sharing, is more accurate at rating the peak versus the cheapies, and if you don't want to use the app there's a chart included that is also very helpful. I've never been so pleased with a pee stick in my life. It might be because this cycle has been really frustrating, seriously not ovulating until CD 49, but these are much more accurate going from light to dark than the cheapies.",t3_iow82d
138,TryingForABaby,"Almost 5 years ago, when I was 30 yo, I had an unexpected pregnancy which I found out at about 5 weeks along. My relationship at time wasn’t great. We had agreed that we were not ready to have a baby, but when I got pregnant I wanted to keep it. My ex and I argued back and forth which resulted in him telling me to have an abortion and walking out of the room. I didn’t want them to be born into an unhappy relationship with a father who didn’t want them. So I went to my obgyn and got pills for a chemical abortion. I had the most severe cramps, but that didn’t hurt as much as the sadness. That night, my ex asked if I was going to bed I said no I’ll just sit here for awhile. So he went to sleep. I sat around and finally picked myself up to go shower where I cried my heart out at the loss of my baby and that I, as their mother, did it. When I went to bed my ex was fast asleep and snoring, I think I resented him then and that was the start of the end of our relationship. 

We had sex probably once at most twice a week, and used the pull out method. So yes, I thought when the time comes when I’m actually trying to get pregnant I’d be pregnant in the first try or so. 

Fast forward to now, I have the most amazing bf, and we will be engaged soon. We wanted to start trying because I will turn 35 and we want two+ kids. We’ve been having unprotected sex since last December, so for 9 months. I’ve also been tracking my LH surge and I’d have a surge every month. For the past 6 months, we made sure to BD around then. This last month we BD’d 1 day before LH surge, on the day and the day after. My bf does have low sperm concentration and motility. His SA in March showed a total of 2 million progressive motile sperms. I know this is low and I think we need at least 20 million progressive motile sperms? We also are testing using the at home YO test and his concentration and motility appear to be higher now (likely from vitamin supplements and extra zinc).

Last night was 13dpo and AF appeared. Now I’m feeling sad and depressed at another cycle of nothing. I feel like God is punishing me for giving up on my first pregnancy. I know that this sadness will pass in a day or two and then I will be hopeful again for the next month.",t3_iociy2

I decided to be proactive and get some fertility testing done after Cycle 7 was unsuccessful. The RE is very supportive with my approach and ordered a SA for my husband (normal results). I just had my Day 3 tests along w/ a sonogram. So far so good with antral follical count and no uterine fibroids. 

I'm now scheduled for both a HSC (Hysteroscopy?) and an HSG on CD9. I was ignorant at the time and said I wanted to do both on the same day, but now I'm looking at the overview of the procedure and it's freaking me out. I can't bare the thought of having my cervix probed twice in one day. My question: Is it really necessary to do both? I see a lot of posts about HSG but not so much on HSC. If I had to only do one, which one would be more helpful?",t3_ip0ckr
143,TryingForABaby,"A quick background before I jump in: I'm 38, no kids. My DH and I started TTC last Oct. 2019 and got a BFP the first month, but at almost 6 weeks I miscarried. Since then no BFPs! :(  I've had an HSG (totally normal and open), Progesterone testing (did this for 3 mos and #s always indicated O occurred), and my husband had a full blood panel and semen analysis. His motility and count are awesome, but his morphology is low (3). Two OBs have said that they are not concerned about the morphology bc his count is off the charts. That was 3 months ago.

FFWD to this cycle. We moved to a new town and I started seeing a new OB. In my first visit to establish a relationship and find out how to proceed under his care, he put me on Clomid. We know that I've O'd in the past but he said sometimes the body just needs an extra bump from Clomid. So I took 50mg cd 3-7. Until now, my cycles are 29-32 days and my O has been on cd14-16. This month, I started using CB Advanced Digital OPKs beginning cd10 and been testing 2x/day bc I'll be damned if I'm missing it. On cd13 in the morning I had a blank circle but that evening I had a solid smiley face. UGH! So DH and I dtd. Then I learn that there can be an increase LH w/o O that leads to a false positive  opk AND that Clomid can push your O day later and make cycles longer. I let the OPK reset and kept testing. Two days of more blanks, then yesterday, on the AM and PM of cd19, I got a flashing smiley and yet again this morning, cd20. DH and I have dtd on cd18 &amp; 19 and will keep at it. My cm hasn't been as much this cycle and wasn't egg white at cd12/13/14, but on cd18 it started really producing a lot of wet, cloudy, sticky cm. I don't do temps, my OB said don't bother. And Idk what it means but since I the flashing smiley face I've had pangs of cramping pain or tenderness in my uterus.

Am I going crazy? Should I be happy about this flashing smiley as a chance that MAYBE the clomid just delayed my O (by 5 days)? Can anyone explain ANY of this madness?? Thanks :)",t3_iovt5z
144,TryingForABaby,"Precursor: I am NOT currently temping  and I do realize that is the only way to accurately confirm if I am preparing to/have ovulated. If nothing else this situation has resolved me to actually start using the BBT I purchased so that I don’t have this happen next cycle!

So I have been off HBC since I finished my last pack at the end of January. Have been tracking my cycles ever since (no period while on BC) and have had consistent 32-33 day cycles since February.

I started using the CBAD OPK at the end of April and had a good experience, got a Peak during my first cycle using it, and have stuck with it ever since. Typically for me there are at most 3 Low days, and usually at least 5-6 days of High Results before I get a Peak result. I do get CM in the days leading up to my Peaks but the type can vary by month. My period has consistently come within 2 weeks of me getting my Peak result. 

This cycle, I finished my period on CD 5 and started testing on CD 9 (a few days earlier than I normally would, but not much). Today is now CD 16 and I have gotten Low results on my CBAD every day since I started testing last week. Based on previous cycles I should get a Peak around CD18, and I am definitely having progesterone symptoms (cramps, nausea, breaking out) but according to my reader... nothing. 

I realize you *cannot* read the dye results on the testing stick of the CBAD but the line that indicates LH on the tester HAS been getting darker the past few days. 

All of this makes me wonder: does anyone have experience with getting a faulty test reader? I’m pretty sure it’s just an infrared scanner in there reading the results, and I assume they’re not immune to damage- is there any chance it could be misreading my results? I still had my tester from the previous box so I tested with that one this morning as well, but since it was my first use with it I obviously won’t get a ‘real’ result from it until tomorrow and in the mean time I’m quite anxious!

I intended to purchase some cheapie strips for this cycle but never got around to it because I decided my CBAD has always been reliable... really kicking myself for that now 😂

TLDR; Anyone have experience with a faulty CBAD reader? Trying to determine if technology or my body is on the fritz this month. Thanks everyone!",t3_iovp4d

We considered carrying donated eggs but when I got off my preventive migraine mediation, my migraines got so bad that I don’t think it can be an option.

We were thinking of overseas surrogacy because it’s significantly more expensive here US than in the Ukraine, Russia, or Georgia. However, I can’t seem to find genuine reviews about these overseas surrogacy programs or agencies. And I’ve also read about some horror stories.

160,TryingForABaby,"Does anyone else ever feel this way? 

We've been TTC since January (when my Mirena was removed) I'm tracking CM, BBT, and LH. We have conceived once this year, and I'm hoping to conceive my rainbow 🌈 baby.

This cycle is screwing with me. I use Femometer, and it typically has my fertile window start about 1.5 weeks after my period begins. OPKs typically confirm this. Saturday was supposed to be the FIRST day of my fertile window, and I had EW CM! What the heck! So Femometer assumed I ovulated that day.

But OPKs are just now starting to look positive as of today. I'm so confused 😣 

Has anyone else had this experience? What the heck is happening? I just want to know when I ovulate lol",t3_ioit7e
161,TryingForABaby,can anyone help with advice? my period is usually on the 13th. last month it was the 14th. I believe ovulation was the first. Currently using Ovia app to track things. I checked my cervix which is soft right now. i have been bloated for 3 days like really badly. trying not to turn into a crazy person during fertile times. but I feel ovulation passed a while a go since my period usually should be coming soon. the app is saying ovulation is coming now???,t3_ioy40l
162,TryingForABaby,"Ladies! After being 14 days late I finally got my period. I am SO excited I literally screamed with joy “I GOT MY PERIOD” from the upstairs bathroom to my husband haha. I knew I wasn’t pregnant and I was waiting for that fresh new cycle and I can’t wait to try again. The last few months all I have been taking were First Response chewy prenatals, raising my legs after BD, and LH testing/bbt temping. But I was thinking of trying some other things. Does anyone have other supplements or plain old tips/tricks to getting pregnant? Possibly something my husband can try as well?",t3_iol2p0
163,TryingForABaby,"I honestly can’t think of anywhere else to post this. 

I’ll start off with saying that husband and I are NTNP currently - it’s beyond unlikely we will ever conceive naturally due to my husband’s cancer and his treatments around it. The odds of us ever conceiving naturally are so low, it’s basically like hitting the full lottery. Still, I use Glow and a couple other apps to track my cycle, when I ovulate, and my own health overall to make sure nothing weird is going on.


Back when June rolled in, life was rolling as best as it has been for all of us in the world of COVID insanity, so I didn’t think much of my period until a month had passed - we’re in July now - and I had no period. Shrugged, figured it was stress of the times, and told myself that if it didn’t show up the following week I’d take a HPT. Well I ended up letting two weeks pass with no period, but also no symptoms in any way that stood out besides my boobs getting bigger, and I only remember this because I made the comment to my husband that “I guess my boobs are growing with age, go me?” and laughed it off. 


When I realized eight weeks came and went with no period, I decided to take the HPT and see if, by some insane miracle, I managed to actually get pregnant. Except the only tests I had left in the house were the Wondfo ones from Amazon, and they expired back in November 2019. Took it, read as a BFN. I shrugged it off and went back about my day. A little over a week later, I had the lightest period of my life. Basically was two days of casual spotting in bright red, and then nothing. Two weeks after that, I had one of the worst periods of my life - serious cramping (the kind that makes you wonder if you should visit an ER), dark red clots half the size of my palms for the first two days followed by three days of steady standard flow for me. 


Was this... was this something that I just completely missed? I don’t experience irregular cycles, the longest I’ve had a period delay was two weeks (and that was under extreme stress when my mother literally died in front of me from a sudden cardiac arrest), it’s running around in my head and I don’t know how to put this to rest. I never even thought to look up if pregnancy tests were accurate past their expiration date, so I had no idea that expired ones can give false negatives. And I honestly had no symptoms like I did with my first CP, I just felt like I always do, maybe a little bit tired but who isn’t tired in this crazy world right now? If I saw my OBGYN, would they be able to tell me if I had recently MC’d?",t3_iopxvf

165,TryingForABaby,"Perhaps some of you can relate to this; the division of labor in TTC is somewhat unfair. This came to a head with my husband and I when we were hanging out with some of our male friends who complained about their wives telling them when to have sex when they were trying for their babies. I don't want to do that; I thought I could take a break from *telling* him when I'm fertile and just try to have sex every second day. This proved to be a bit exhausting for us, and I still ended up tracking and managing our sex life. 

Now I've looked into an app that will do it for me; I downloaded Glow and linked him to the account so he will get informed about our fertile window. I don't like the layout of the app, I find it busy. Is this something anyone else is trying? Is it working for you? What apps do you use?",t3_iobwma
166,TryingForABaby,"Hi everyone, just joined the group. I go by Kat in real life and my last name starts with a W hence “dub” for my username katdub. 

Some background... I was never sure I wanted kids but after meeting my now husband I realized I loved the idea of little humans with him. My husband, on the other hand, has always wanted kids. However, it is only recently that we have felt like we were financially in the place to try. I am 27 and he is 26. I am currently at the end of graduate school and he is working as a lab tech but wants to go back to school to be a vet. 

I’ve always been scared I won’t ever conceive since I have PCOS. My mom had it and had both ovaries removed after having me because there were so many cysts, and my aunt and grandma and her sisters all had similar issues or ovarian cancer and have all had their ovaries removed. Some had kids, and some could not. So it’s been something I’ve always known about growing up and hence never really felt a compelling need for kids. Perhaps because I just accepted the fact I may never have the chance.

I got my first period when I was 18 and then only had periods every 3-5 months following. Then I went to planned parenthood (no heath insurance) and they told me I had PCOS (which my mom already predicted) and put me on birth control. I have been on BC ever since, with some occasions when I was off of it b/c of insurance issues and even then never/rarely had a period. 

I know there is a sub for TTC with PCOS, but to be honest I’m very confused with all the medication and acronyms they use. I thought perhaps starting here would be nice first. Like I said, I am in graduate school and specifically in the STEM field... so I am neurotic when it comes to research and preparing. As such I think I’ve freaked myself out into obsessing over TTC. I’ve watched so many YouTube’s of women’s journeys and read and PCOS and methods to conceive and i think I’m stressing myself out into already accepting this won’t happen for me. 

When I try to talk about how worried I am with my husband he tries to be comforting but I think he’s annoyed now and just tells me not to worry or stress out. 

I guess what I’m hoping to get from this group are tips on what you have gone through or what you do first? Like I mention earlier, I used to go to Planned parenthood because of lack of insurance (parents come from a low socioeconomic background) and so the health care industry and doctors are just not something I’m the most comfortable or familiar about. So, should I be going to the doctor first and asking for an OBGYN before even trying? Or should I just try for the heck of it and see what happens? Do I go buy prenatal vitamins right away and the ovulation sticks? I just feel, lost I guess... and paranoid and worried. And maybe irrationally so idk. 

Thanks in advance! ❤️",t3_iolo64

I’m nervous I’m having chemical pregnancies but my endometrium is too thin or something to carry a pregnancy, which is why I spot for a couples the week before my periods (this is definitely not correlated with ovulation as timing is off by a few days). Is my progesterone low? It’s frustrating talking with the doctor because she says nothing and essentially that we just need to try for longer.

Feeling just like I did 2 cycles ago when I actually got pregnant (it was a CP, but the symptoms were real and undeniable).

We took a cycle off last month, and I paid very close attention to how I felt during my luteal phase to help me not symptom spot in the future. 

And I felt absolutely nothing except sore breasts a few days before my period.

I have yet to test early, I always wait until I’m at least 1 day late, or my period comes. And yet, the itch is real! (I also have mosquito bites all over my legs that literally itch, and that’s not helping at all!).

183,TryingForABaby,"Hi! So, we've only recently started TTC for our first child. Last month we tried for the first time. Great! Feeling excited about it, good thoughts, etc. Then, within the next week after starting to try, I get hit with a sudden and very bad UTI (made it up to the kidneys, fever, blood in the urine, etc.). I had to take the day off work, be miserable waiting in line in urgent care, and overall just being miserable. And, of course, once it finally cleared up I got hit with my period a day early, on the day I was going to test...so at least I didn't need to waste a test.  To be clear, UTIs have rarely been an issue before TTC, and hasn't been in years since I changed some habits.

 So, to be sure I didn't have this trouble again I bought cranberry supplements, we talked about extra hygiene precautions (making sure to wash hands before, showering before, etc.). So I think we've got it covered. Well, we go to try again last week and get hit with another UTI! It's so incredibly frustrating! It has never been a problem with condoms, but now that we're going without it seems to be something that's going to continue to be a problem. Now I'm in the TWW, and honestly, though I do really want the positive because I'm ready to have a baby-- I also just really don't want to have to go through yet another month of a UTI. 

I have contacted my doctor to set up an appointment to maybe get on a prophylactic to prevent UTI, so I am aware it's an option.   


I just really needed to vent about how much this sucks, since there really isn't anything I can do about the no-condom situation when TTC, but we haven't told our friends and family that we're trying yet (I don't need that pressure)...so I can't really talk to them about it.

My husband and I have never been stronger.

When we started trying, we had been married 7 months, lived together for 2 years, together for 4. We’ve had our ups and downs, as most couples do. 

After we’ve continued to try for our baby, I was terrified this would break us. Thought we’d blame each other for different issues, etc. But not at all. The first time in our journey I emerged from the bathroom in tears from early spotting yet again, he held me and made it all better in the moment. He’s been open to anything I’d been wanting to try to help us. We laugh even harder together, talk more, and (duh) have more sex.

We fell pregnant quickly but that resulted in a loss at 6 weeks and ever since my body hasn’t been right, long cycles and late ovulation. I’m desperate to become a mum and I find myself feeling overwhelmed and sad at times that I’m not yet pregnant whilst everyone around me is announcing their pregnancies.

My cycle is a clean cut textbook cycle and I'm never late and I ovulate right on day 14. I already have 2 amazing children and we've never had trouble conceiving before. Now I know I'm really early to test and it's only really the 1st month but my optimism from before has turned into fear that what if I never get pregnant again. There's no reason I should feel this way yet but I can't help it. For some reason I've completely turned my excitement into obsession and it's driving me crazy. I feel this impulse to test all the time incase I read the previous test wrong and I always thought testing early wouldn't bother me but I guess I'm wrong. Many women have given advice to not test early for this reason but I thought it wouldn't have affected me this way.

I’m 34, husband is 41 and we’re about to embark on the insane train of trying for #2. Or 3. Depending on how you look at it. Background:

I got pregnant September of 2015. Had some bleeding around 7 weeks and went in for an early ultrasound only to find out that we were having twins. Two strong heartbeats. All I could say was “what the fuck is happening” for several hours after leaving the appointment. Fast forward to May of 2016. I had a mostly fine (but uncomfortable) pregnancy. I gave birth (that’s a very long story, but I did have two live births) and the next day one of my girls died. I won’t give too many details, but we’re currently in litigation with the hospital and doctors. I tried to “fix” it by getting pregnant again six months later only to miscarry at 9 weeks. Turns out that’s not how that works.

So, after many years of uncertainty (we were supposed to be done. We wanted two, we got two) we’ve decided that our 4 year old was never supposed to be alone, that we have room in our hearts for another, and that we would always regret not trying.

199,TryingForABaby,"I know that my life hasn't taken a 'typical' route, but instead of lamenting it, I want to embrace it. I fell pregnant at 20, and became a single mother at 21. A couple years later, I married a wonderful man who turned out to be infertile; he adopted my child, and I grieved the loss of having any more biological children. In my mid-30s, we parted ways and I let myself feel hope that maybe that door wasn't closed forever. 

Now at 42, I'm in a relationship with a 30 year old man who would love to be a father. I can't decide if it's the best or the craziest idea to have children 20-plus years apart, and I don't know how difficult it may be to conceive at my age. Whilst I have regular cycles, I have very low AMH. We're in our first cycle now, and BBT confirmed ovulation was last week.

My husband and I have been TTC for 3 months now.

I don’t want to bring down the excitement of my two pregnant friends because I am really happy for them, and even though the third is very supportive It seems insensitive to talk about how stressful the wait is when I’ve only been waiting 3 months and she’s been trying for years.

My mom and my pregnant friend both love to tell me to “just relax” and “stop tracking and worrying about everything” “it will happen at the right time” which is the most unhelpful advice ever. 

I don’t really know what I’m looking for I’m just sad and frustrated and impatient and I’m sick of worrying that every single thing I eat or drink or do is going to reduce my chances of pregnancy.

I have researched on the internet a lot, but I can find evidence to support both drinking and not drinking during the TWW...Anyway, just wanted to put this out and see if anyone can commiserate with me or give their opinions on drinking v not drinking during the TWW.

Month 1 and 2: 30 Day cycle

Month 3: 27 day cycle

Month 4: 2 days late and getting lots of BFN...

Had some period cramps the past few days but now it's as if theres no period in sight.. 

It would happen to me that my periods are super regular coming off the pill for the first 3 months when those are supposed to be the 'you may not bleed' months - and right when i think i'm safe, AF starts playing tricks on me. 

I guess theres the tiniest bit of hope of still getting that BFN, but after seeing it on 16 DPO... i just want AF to show up so i can start trying again .",t3_inzw1w

I also had a longer run of low temperatures pre- ovulation than normal, so I just seem to have had a wilder hormonal swing that I normally do.

212,TryingForABaby,"Hi everyone,

I’ll cut to the chase - due to some feelings of added pressure to make a baby and personal stress due to work, my husband has been experiencing performance anxiety. We regularly only BD 1-2 times around my fertile days and I’m worried we are missing them entirely or lowering our chances by only hitting one day. 

I gave up using OPKs because they were increasing the anxiety and so we are just trying around CD10-20. It feels hard to talk to him about because I’m so concerned I’ll add to the pressure, but it’s also so hard to try night after night and not have it work out.

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you time BD? Any advice on ways to help my husband relax or general suggestions?",t3_ins6ea
213,TryingForABaby,"My husband and I have been trying for over a year now. It’s been rough to say the least. Last year, around October/November we paused for those 2 months to avoid me having a baby right at the start of the school year. Now we’re faced with that choice again. Last time, it was an easy decision as we had just began trying. Now, it’s a lot harder. The thought of having to wait two more months to keep trying is awful. 
Here are my struggles... 

1. Since it has taken us this long to fall pregnant (both gone to the doctor with no issues), it seems crazy to push it out only for us to be in the same position again potentially in another year 
2. If I don’t skip those months and do manage to fall pregnant, I have set myself up for an insane amount of stress when I have the baby. I can’t imagine someone else setting up my class and the students beginning the year without me. I’m worried it will make the entire school year difficult 

My husband thinks we should keep trying. But at the same time, I’m not sure he understands how much my anxiety will skyrocket with the added stress of a school year beginning without me there to set routines/expectations and all that. 

Are there any teachers who are about to be faced with the same decision? Or should I let this go and quit making it such a big thing. While I love my students, my family is 100% my priority. I just don’t want to set myself up for an even rougher year with a newborn on top of that.",t3_inlyfn

215,TryingForABaby,"My husband and I have been trying to conceive for a little over a year now. We have had 1 ectopic pregnancy and one chemical. My cycles have been quite irregular and my luteal phases are fairly short, anywhere from 9-11 days long, but recently they’ve been more consistently 10-11 days. I suspect my progesterone is low, but I’m not able to get any testing done until my next cycle. I know a lot of people usually get their first positive 10-11 dpo, so would a 10-11 day LP almost always result in failure? I’m 9 DPO now and no AF yet, but also have gotten BFN tests thus far. Should I be concerned about this in my TTC journey?

One day, there is going to be a minute when it’s just me and a positive line, when I’m the only person in the whole world who knows a secret, when it’s just me and Bug communing, and then I get to leave and tell. But until then, Goddamn, I hate that moment before I open the door.",t3_in86nx

220,TryingForABaby,"After being on HBC essentially my entire menstruating life, I had never considered that my natural cycle would last longer than the 28-ish days that I’m used to. After going off the pill in May, I’ve found every month my cycle gets a few days longer and I’m now up to 37 days.

TTC takes so much planning and conscious effort — BBT charting, lifestyle changes, mentally preparing for pregnancy and motherhood, gently informing my husband when we have to have sex even if we aren’t in the mood, etc. and I know you’re all well aware that it can be exhausting. 

What I’m struggling with is keeping up the momentum when I not only have to endure the TWW, but then another three weeks or more of waiting until I can even try again. I’m having some difficulty with the TTC process as well, from inconsistent sleep cycles making it difficult to get an accurate BBT reading, to my husband experiencing performance issues as soon as he knows I’m ovulating. I guess I just feel kind of helpless, and with so much time between tries it’s easy to feel disheartened and like I don’t even want to bother. And it’s only my fourth cycle. 

Does this resonate with anyone, maybe other TTC ladies with longer cycles?",t3_inhxdo
221,TryingForABaby,"So, I have a funny/silly story to tell.

TTC sucks. We've been at it 2 years, BBT charting, OPKs, checking CM/CP, being happy yet envious of pregnant friends, trying to come up with excuses, all of it, just plain sucks.

So this morning I wake up to the sound of my alarm, time to take my BBT🙄! Well, my temp was not where I wanted it to be. So I did what any rational individual would do and because it was obviously the thermometer's FAULT, I rather forcefully hucked it at my nightstand. Well, it precedes to bounce off said night stand and hit the wall then fall somewhere in the corner behind/beside my dresser. ""Fine F@#K YOU TOO"" I say and I go back to bed because nobody else in the house is awake and I don't want to be either! 

Fast forward to tonight, I'm looking for the damn thing and I finally decide to give up it's late (midnight) and I just want to sleep. 

At first, I was upset that I would have a blank spot in the middle of my chart, but I have decided for Sunday I'm gonna say F@#K it, F@$k all of it, the thermometer, the chart, everything. Tomorrow I am going to wake up whenever I want, make breakfast, have a cup of coffee and get on with my life without thinking about anything TTC related. Yah know what? It feels good just knowing that tomorrow I can just have a day free from all the BS.

So, in short, Happy Labour Day, try and treat yourselves to a no BS, nonTTCing day!

If you feel down, just picture an angry half asleep woman sitting on the side of the bed damn near hucking a thermometer across the room lol.",t3_iniclj

DTD on O+2,O+1, O

226,TryingForABaby,"Hi everyone, happy Saturday! 

Quick vent because it's still annoying me. I recently had a major life event (master's degree) and my in-laws came to visit to celebrate me. My SIL is 21 and recently had a baby with a horrible guy. He's no longer in the picture so my in-laws are helping her.

My niece was sweet and she really took to me. Of course I felt a little sting because my SIL got this when she didn't even want it but I kept using positive self that and enjoyed my time playing with our niece. (I know it's not fair of me to be upset at her for enjoying being a mom but it hurts).

Now, my MIL's friends come to visit and right out of the car they start asking me when I'm getting pregnant... On my big exciting weekend, I ended up being told to do this, do that, try this, I'm trying to hard, and I'll understand it all when I finally have my own. I don't know why I didn't have the confidence to tell them to drop it. It was so frustrating especially considering I'd just had an ultrasound and bloodwork done to look over everything so I was waiting on hearing results.

229,TryingForABaby,"I always had crazy vivid dreams and tonight was a dedicated dramatic episode for TTC...

The Nightmare:
Had a dream where my husband cheated on me and still wants to stay with me and the new girl (whom he got pregnant). He acted like nothing had happened and wanted both of us in his life. In my dream, I made a 2h call to my father in law explaining whats happened and as part of the convo...I said ""We been trying for 6 months and the reason we can't conceived is because he conceived already with someone else..."" was hoping for him to help amend the situation (not sure what I was hoping for) but instead he said he'll be supportive of my decision to leave the relationship. I was shocked cause I love my husband too much to leave him and then realize that's reality and the right choice... I met up with my husband and he acted like nothing happened and I explained that I need to leave the relationship aka divorce.  I'm not living with a 3rd party's baby and a 3rd party. I can't live like that even though I love him. I don't want to ruin the beautiful memory we had together. My heart was so so so broken in my dream. 

Impact
Woke up at dramatic ending and my entire body was feeling WARM. Took the BBT and it is 97.19 and my previous BBT were around 96.8. I have maybe 3-5 days before ovulation.

My husband and I have just barely begun discussing the idea of getting pregnant in the next year or so. I want to start getting my body, mind, and home ready for everything that will entail.

Personally not a huge fan of going to the doctor. However I want to form a relationship with a doctor so that when the time comes I am not starting from scratch.

231,TryingForABaby,"I am so sad to be writing this. 
I posted in the BFP thread a few weeks back when I found out I was pregnant. I had tears of joy after my husband and I had been trying for 7 months. 
When I was 6 weeks pregnant, I started to have a miscarriage. First time I’ve experienced this. With Covid, I had to go alone to my appointment where I saw pictures of babies on the wall, hearing heartbeats in the rooms next to me, and seeing happy pregnant women. It was heart wrenching for me to sit in my room, alone, knowing I was losing my baby and the one thing I want more than anything. The doctor did a vaginal ultrasound and we could see the sac with the baby inside. This made it even harder for me. Why was there something wrong? I could see the little bean. It didn’t seem fair. The doctor said the baby wasn’t growing and was too tiny and my HCG levels were too low. I would lose the baby over the weekend or need a D&amp;C if my body didn’t do it naturally. I walked out of the office in tears.
But, I’ve spoken to a few women who have experienced this and have really helped me so far. And I know there’s so many others who know the feeling and it’s very common. I am not mad at my body. I know my body is sadly and unfortunately recognizing that something wasn’t right and is trying to fix it. I am just so disappointed and sad. I keep thinking: why me? It feels like I waited so long and then this happened. And it really is a selfish question the more I dwell on it. I can’t complain when I have to be strong and realize there’s far worse things. I have to remember how blessed I am in so many other ways. We all do sometimes. I have a 2 year old son, and I won’t give up having another. I’ll save that big brother tshirt I was so excited to see him wear. Even if there’s hurdles along the way and it doesn’t go according as planned. It’s not in my power, I can only do what I can. Keep trying to be healthy and keep trying for a baby. I know I’ll get my rainbow baby. I know this sad, horrible phase will end soon. But I’ll carry it with me for a while. And for now, I’m allowed to be sad.

234,TryingForABaby,"A little background- my husband (31) and I (27) have been TTC for 18 months now. Two days after my first IUI, my doctor told me that I (most likely) had stage 4 endo after finding a cyst on my ovary and a buildup of endometrium on both ovaries. He said that realistically, he thinks I can get pregnant but only through IVF. He doesn’t want to do laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis bc he sees it as unnecessary since I have no endo pain. So, in other words, I have a less than 1% chance of conceiving naturally and IUI won’t help bc my eggs are being compromised due to the endo. 

My question is for those going through IVF- how are you paying for it? I’m a teacher and he’s a retail manager, so it’s not like we have thousands just laying around.

I had a miscarriage in April and have noticed my body is still “resetting.” My cycles are not as consistent as they were before the miscarriage, my ovulation is also different. My peak ovulation days have been a little longer (usually 4-5 days) and then I hit my ovulation day. This last month I started tracking with BBT and based on my temps, fertility friend confirmed ovulation on cd13 butttt opk tests starting showing flashing smiley face (peak days) on cd 14-cd 17. Is that possible? And if so, which do I go by? 

I have been following the SMEP plan so I start trying on cd 10, and then every other day until opk is positive but based on the bbt it looks like I need to start getting down sooner.  Help!

241,TryingForABaby,"Good evening, folks! I have a quick question on behalf of my sister who doesn't use Reddit. She's been diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, but she isn't currently seeking treatment. She and her partner are NTNP. She's trying to see if she's actually ovulating by using a Temp Drop and OPKs. Her temperature looks like she's ovulating- at least according to Fertility Friend. But she's had no luck at all with the digital OPK- no blinking smiley face, no solid smiley face and she's testing for most of her cycle. She has been getting a regular period. Is it possible to ovulate and have the OPK not catch it at all? 

Obviously she will go back to her RE to get to the bottom of this, but we were curious if anyone has been in the same boat! Thanks!

I have a fair amount of data as I'm over 30 and was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 23, so over the last few years I've been able to get quite a few tests that are typically reserved for those who have been trying to conceive for a while. I figured I'd share what I have so far for anyone who has a similar profile to me.

**A quick prologue:** 

I am 35, a few months going on 36. I was diagnosed with PCOS in my early 20s and had wildly unpredictable periods, hormonal acne, a tiny amount of excess hair, but have never been overweight. I'm actually quite petite, something of an outlier for someone with PCOS, but I definitely carry weight around my midsection. In my late 20s to early 30s I went off HBC and started to normalize my cycles through diet, exercise, and supplements. Over the last several years I've had tests done to dig a little more into my PCOS diagnosis/expectations. While I now appear to be ovulating regularly, I was just diagnosed last month with subclinical hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's. Am now taking Synthyroid as of last month. I'm also going to start Metformin, less for cycle regularity and more to prevent PCOS-related MCs when I'm TTC. 


**I.**

As mentioned, I was diagnosed with PCOS at 23. Through my teens and 20s I would go six months at times without a period (it was always fun explaining to a new boyfriend why I hadn't had a period after two months of dating when they started freaking out that I'm pregnant). I've also battled terrible bouts of hormonal acne, most recently in early 2017 where I literally had horns on my face continuously for months. My father has type 2 diabetes but I never was flagged for having any pre-diabetes or insulin issues. An RE told me when I was around 28 that I just had a straight up hormonal imbalance after doing bloodwork when I started digging into this more seriously. When I was first diagnosed at 23, I was just put on BC and went my merry-ish way without explanation. I did take spironolactone prescribed by a derm to help my skin around 2012-2013 and went off it in 2014.

After my latest bout of hormonal acne in 2017, I got more serious about supplements. I swear by this one for helping regulate my hormones and cycles. It's got DIM, Vitex, and Red Raspberry which I think are all-star PCOS supplements. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A34PISW

I also got more serious about exercise. Vigorous exercise is typically listed as a culprit for anovulation and amenhorea (it happened to a friend) but for me I think it's helped a lot. As I've said before, I've always been petite but carried weight in my midsection. I focused more on adding muscle than losing weight, and right now have a BMI of 19.7. In all honesty I think the exercise may have helped more from a stress management perspective. I don't diet or cut out anything specific, but I do eat vegan meals like 1/2 the time (maybe 1/3 during quarantine) and I think I get a lot of the recommended food groups for fertility. Adding more veggies to my diet is another thing I've worked towards over the last couple years.


**II.** 

Over the last 12 months, my cycles have been 30-35 days (the 35 only happening once) with an average of 31-32 which is pretty darn good based on where I came from. The year prior they were less regular, and ranged from 24-42, which was still an improvement from the year prior and so on. I did start taking prenatals (the ones from Ritual) in 2018 and from what I've read on this sub it could also have assisted in regulating my cycles.


**III.** 

In July 2018 when I was 33 I decided I wanted to know whether I was ovulating in order to set my expectations for the future if I were to TTC. I'm very impatient and I like to be prepared for the worst case scenario :)  Luckily my age and PCOS diagnosis allowed me to talk my OBGYN into it. 

The cycle they tested me during ended up being 34 days. On CD2 my TSH was 1.97 (perhaps a sign that hypothyroidism was coming on), FSH 4.4, Progesterone 1.7, and AMH 10.36. On CD16 (aka 19 days before my period) a large follicle was seen on my ultrasound and the tech expected I was going to ovulate (you can also imagine her confusion when she saw my IUD). She lost count of my follicles so I don't have an exact #.

Then on CD21 they tested my progesterone. Never mind that a progesterone surge on CD20/21 is typical for a 28 day cycle and I told the OGBYN I had long cycles, even showing her my data in Glow. I'm now convinced OBGYNs know shit about fertility. Anyway, unsurprisingly it came back at 1.65. They tested me again on CD24 (11 days before my period) and it was 9.26.

Based on what I've learned so far from this sub (devbio, you really should write a book) and google, a result above 3 means you ovulated, and above 10 suggests adequate production to maintain pregnancy. Assuming I produce progesterone normally (got some Proov strips in the mail for future testing) I was maybe a few days pre-peak on CD24. From what I've read, typically (in a 28 day cycle), progesterone is tested a week post ovulation, and 6-8 days before the last week of your cycle.

For me in a 34 day cycle, 6-8 days prior would have been CD27-29. Assuming one week post-ovulation, it would mean I ovulated between Days 20-22. Glow predicted my ovulation at Day 21 (the day my first test was taken without showing a surge and 5 days post ultrasound showing a large follicle). So it seems it may be possible that I ovulate on the ""normal"" 14 days before my next cycle, or at least I did then. Based on my ultrasound and the progesterone test, I'm giving myself a possible ovulation window of CD17 (the day after my ultrasound) and CD23 (the day before my progesterone was 9.26) during that cycle without better data on my progesterone levels on other days, temping, etc.


**IV.** 

Fast forward to July 2020, I'm getting tests again as I'm ready to start TTC and am now 35. My AMH is now 7.27, I have 60 follicles (31 and 29 on either side), had a good looking corpus luteum on a CD26 ultrasound, healthy uterine lining, and a slightly longer than average cervix. With my pretty regular periods and now 2nd time confirming it's possible for me to ovulate... I left my appt pleasantly surprised. Then boom my blood test comes back with 3.69 TSH. Was tested again a week later to confirm and it had dropped slightly to 2.76, but showed I have anti-thyroid antibodies. This was initially a shock but I've since learned hypothyroidism is linked to PCOS. Just when I thought I ""cured"" myself of PCOS! After a day reading clinical studies on the effects of Hashimoto's and hypothyroidism on fertility/pregnancy and crying at my computer, I spoke with a specialist. She told me you can't really cure PCOS, the studies I read are are flawed, and sometimes overtesting just makes people worried for no reason. She agreed with my RE (P.S. I'm going to Kindbody in NYC at the moment through this latest round of investigation) that I should take Synthyroid and Metformin primarily to prevent MC and/or developmental issues.


**V.** 

Started taking 50mg of Synthyroid nearly a month ago, and will have my TSH tested again soon so see whether it's dropping. I've requested they test my T3 and T4 as well. Just had a metabolic test ahead of being prescribed Metformin (I think to set a baseline/make sure I don't have any existing liver issues). Checking in with the RE at Kindbody again this week for next steps.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data I have so far, my guess is I can ovulate anywhere between CD15 and CD23 depending on cycle length. I've recently begun using OPKs (Clearblue Advanced Digital + Easy@Home cheapies for comparison) I started two days ago on CD13. Today on CD15, I got my first flashing smiley. My BBT thermometer just arrived today and my Proov strips should arrive this week, so hopefully I can start confirming and charting ovulation as early as this current cycle.

I'm a bit worried that when I start Metformin it could throw my current regularity off kilter and I'll be starting from square one. So far Synthyroid hasn't had an impact. My last cycle was 32 days, and I began taking it on CD18 or 19 (can't remember exactly). I'm also about to start a new prenatal that's a combo with egg quality supplements (it has CoQ10, etc).

I was originally looking at embryo freezing due to my age, with the addition of just using one up front since I was gonna go through the whole thing anyway. After reading more about what that's like on this and other subs, I've decided to try naturally for a few months first. I figure if I'm able to confirm ovulation with some regularity, I'd rather avoid overstimulating my ovaries as I imagine I'd be at high risk for that. 

**P.S.**

If any of this is relevant to you, I hope to start posting updates and getting active in the community to learn and share info. I've been using Glow for years and like it, but you all talk about FF so much that I'm considering making a switch. Also thinking about buying the Mira for fun and because it's on sale right now.

247,TryingForABaby,"TW: Miscarriage, Other’s Living Child

My friend and I (best friends for 20+ years) were pregnant at the same time. I lost my baby and was supposed to be due this month. She gave birth almost 2 months ago. (I’ve had a few additional losses, but I haven’t shared that information with her. She only knows about 1 miscarriage, due to her insensitive comments/behavior.)

All throughout her pregnancy, she would confide in me about her pregnancy symptoms and pregnant life in general, complain, attention seek - meaning leaning on me to always say positive things to make her feel better, etc. All of our conversations were literally about her being pregnant. We were in her world, not once asking about me or my physical/mental state.

She made it a point to remind me constantly how 5 of her other friends were pregnant at the same time, and that it’ll be awesome to have the kids grow up together.

After my miscarriage, I told her verbatim that I was in a deep depression - so severe that my family wanted me to see a therapist to get better. I requested many times for her to refrain from speaking about her pregnancy (and complaining to me and coming to me to make her feel better and boost her up) and instead urged her to speak to her pregnant friends who would understand and could commiserate with her. This request was not respected, many times. Therefore, I distanced myself meaning I wouldn’t reach out other than to respond/congratulate her when her baby was finally born.

Examples - Complaining about pregnancy and symptoms *daily* (and all throughout the day), talking about how they are planning to have #2 right after (like I get it - it’s easy for you but not for all of us), reminding me how awesome it is that she’s pregnant at the same time as 5 of her friends and their kids will grow up together, she’s due X week and they’ll induce her if she’s not here by a certain day and complaining (at least you made it to the end - all of us aren’t lucky), texting me that her “goal is to keep the baby alive LOL” when months earlier I broke down when telling her about my miscarriage and said verbatim “why couldn’t I keep my baby alive?!” and going through the stages of grief like blaming myself.

Now her baby is almost 2 months old. She sent me a short line of text saying “miss you my friend.” I honestly don’t know how to respond. I mourned her and our friendship a long time ago, and kind of accept it for what it’s evolved to and just think it is what it is. Now she’s back saying she misses me out of the blue. I can’t go back into a friendship where it’s one-sided. I didn’t even get a phone call about the miscarriage. She doesn’t like making calls, which I told her I understand in text but I said I would like to speak to her over the phone about something serious - she knew it was about the miscarriage. I explained that it’s too casual in text. But we ended up just texting about it, not what I wanted. I think calls are appropriate for serious conversations or situations, but I was once again catering to her and her preferences - in a time where I needed support not her. She always declined my invites even before pregnancy, or would accept and then come up with an excuse later to cancel (mostly due to laziness). When it’s not even that much work or effort from her side because when we would meet, I would drive over to her to meet her - she wouldn’t come to my town or even meet in the middle (what I’d recommend so it’s 50/50 effort from both of us). I would see her in person maybe once a year when we live 45 minutes apart, but she chooses to text all day every day about stupid stuff and life. Honestly I would talk to my friends who live in different states over the phone and even make trips to see each other, not just having texting lives where she expects me to respond every day all throughout it the day. This just shows me that distance doesn’t make it more difficult to maintain friendships, so what is our excuse? I felt like I always made an effort, so I’ve just stopped completely now.

Now, why is it fair for her to come back and show interest all of a sudden? I don’t know how to respond at all. Does she just miss my attention and supportive nature?

She is a new mom. She doesn’t like serious talks, and I don’t want to cause her any stress or drama. I feel like it’s not even worth it to tell her the truth of how I feel let down and how our friendship has evolved into acquaintances, at least from my perspective. I think I should just give a gentle response about distance.

My husband, on the other hand, thinks that I’m being sensitive or jealous and said it’s not her fault I had a miscarriage and that she’s excited about her new life. I disagree and think she was repeatedly insensitive for disregarding my boundaries/request. However, my husband knew about my hurt feelings about the one-sidedness about a year prior to her getting pregnant. I literally cried for a month back then (before pregnancy), and it felt like a death. I felt like it was the end of our friendship then (probably not her though due to lack of self awareness), and then our pregnancies kind of brought us back together if that makes sense. I reminded him that she never respected my request after the miscarriage (aka not talking to me every day about her pregnancy), and he said she was probably overly excited to be a first time mom just like I was.

I understand that maybe she has avoided the topic of my infertility (or mental state) in an effort to avoid awkwardness on her part or to avoid making me feel sad, but when I literally say how severe my depression was (which is new and unlike my normal self in general) that my family and *other friends* were encouraging me to see a therapist, I didn’t eat for an entire week after my miscarriage and just cried all day/night and my husband forced me to eat something at that point so I wouldn’t just waste away and die, etc. - how can you ignore this and just talk about yourself in 100% of the texts that you initiate? There’s lack of self awareness, and then there’s selfishness. I think this is both. It’s not like a light switch and then the next time we text, I’ve healed from everything and moved on. Like how can you complain to me about your pregnancy symptoms *daily*, and then need a daily reminder to please stop and speak to your other 5 pregnant friends about the topic because I’m still traumatized and severely depressed?

Opinions wanted - how do you think I should respond? Being 100% honest, just PC short reply to keep it friendly but say I would like distance, or just be friendly and be nice to a new mom who probably needs support (aka my husband’s opinion)? I don’t even know how I should word anything, I’m bad at stuff like that... and it *needs* to be in texts because no calls. Ugh. Any examples of what I could say or how specially to word things?

248,TryingForABaby,"Does anyone else struggle with their sibling’s partners relationship with their mother? 

My brother was the first in our family to make my parents grandparents, they were very young when they had their first &amp; my mum gave a lot of support to my brother’s girlfriend in the early days as she’s not as close to her mum. I’ve always been really close to my mum and I struggle with how their relationship has changed since my brother’s girlfriend had babies. They’d spend a lot of time together, going out for lunches/shopping, just hanging out when she was on maternity leave &amp; still now as they are both part time. The worst part of it has been spending time with them talking about motherhood, I feel like they have a special bond now that I don’t have with my mum because I don’t know what it feels like to go through pregnancy and motherhood. The little knowing looks they give each other when baby stuff is being discussed. Just feels like they’re part of a party that I’m not invited to. 

The logical part of my brain knows this is totally normal grandparent behaviour, of course my mum is going to spend time with her grandchildren and their mother, and of course she is going to give advice &amp; support as a mother. And I’m a grown woman - I don’t need to be hanging out with my mum all the time but I can’t help but feel jealous :( 

I feel like when/if it happens for me, it won’t be as special for my mum because she was so involved with my brothers girlfriends pregnancies, there’s no more “firsts”.

251,TryingForABaby,"I had breakfast with a longtime friend and told her that my husband and I are TTC. When asked, we’ve always told people it wasn’t in the cards for us, so no one is expecting this. She's the only person I've told about this.

During the conversation, I told her that we’ve been trying for at least 5 months, and I’m getting a little discouraged. To that, she responded that I don’t have the right mindset and I need to stop focusing on it. 

After breakfast, I went home and my stomach start to feel super upset, so I texted her to see if she felt a little sick too (wondering if it was food poisoning). She texted back saying she was fine, but then followed it up with asking if it was morning sickness. I was furious.

252,TryingForABaby,"Had my HSG done a couple days ago on day 12. I was really nervous having read horrible experiences (despite my doctor telling me not to google it, of course I did!) but overall it was unpleasant but not painful. 

In Canada (or at least BC) you don’t do the test at your fertility clinic-you get a requisition to take to an x ray center or hospital. In Vancouver there’s only one x ray center that performs the exam plus a few hospitals. My RE advised me it can take months to get in for the test and to expect a longer wait due to COVID backlogs. When I called around on day one, one hospital was booked and the other wasn’t doing the test at all due to COVID. Luckily I got in right away at the x ray clinic!

Now, I’m glad I googled because I was told nothing to prep for the test. I took 400mg Advil an hour before based on what I read from American fertility clinics. ALSO nobody told me you’re not supposed to have sex prior (I think they asked if I had abstained since CD8 or 9? I was too nervous to remember). I found this out at the clinic but luckily we hadn’t since my period stopped. 

The nurse was lovely and the doctor explained everything he was doing (although I feel that made my nerves worse?). I tried my best to keep my body relaxed and it really didn’t feel worse than a regular pap aside from a very slight cramp (less than period cramping) when the dye was injected. Honestly the most uncomfortable part was having to move myself up into a lying flat position and turning to both sides with the speculum in. Whole thing took about 5min and after they had me sit in a room for a few minutes to make sure I was ok before leaving. I’ve had a very small amount of spotting when I go to the bathroom but otherwise fine. 

I was chatting with the nurse after and she said it’s really luck of the draw how soon you get in depending when your cycle starts. She said I was lucky getting in my first try as others wait up to 6mo. 

Also! Don’t be like me and think a thong and panty liner is enough to go home in. The dye is sticky and there’s a lot of it! Thankfully they had pads on hand and I had to try and make that work with a thong (we’ve all been there). I could have driven myself home but I’m glad my husband picked me up just in case.

I’m hoping I’m in the right place. 
My SO and I have been together for two years. We have a little boy (he is not biodad but he is the only father my son has ever known) who is nearly two. We’ve had the odd conversation about names for future kids and he’s said he wanted to look into getting some medical intervention as our attitude from the time little man was around 9 months old has been if it happens it happens. But it hasn’t happened. There’s been a few moments of false hope. He took a paintball to the family jewels about 8 years ago and is now convinced following a loss each with two other partners about 2 years apart that he’s firing blanks. I myself have had one confirmed angel and suspected loss of twins before Little Man came along out of the blue.

At the moment; everybody’s least favourite visitor is in town, so that put the kibbosh on attempting to try this month. However I’m wanting to know if I should sit SO down &amp; discuss actively trying which would mean both of us would have to make some significant changes to our lifestyle (quitting smoking; exercising a little more etc) I’m willing to do it; however I’ve already told my SO I’m unwilling to do IVF if he doesn’t get a SC done first as it could be all for nothing.

My DH and I are early in starting our ttc journey. We unfortunately experienced a miscarriage with our first pregnancy which I was not tracking anything we just were not preventing anymore. 

Now that we are ready to conceive again we are definitely trying to improve our odds with BBT, looking at CM, and LH strips. 

I am curious based on my symptoms when I am ovulating. I experienced EWCM and on the day my LH starting going up (but not considered high or peak) it peaked the next day and remained high the following (but trending down). After the first day of having EWCM my CM significantly decreased.

So I am wondering since my CM was EWCM before the surge and after the surge gone - when did I ovulate?? I thought you ovulate after the surge but that EWCM was also one of the best indicators that you were ovulating.

I am still somewhat in denial about all this that maybe the SA was wrong or incorrect and feeling shocked and down, discouraged, stressed, just a whole bunch of emotions...

On top of that, she thinks I may have an endometrial polyp based on my sonohysterogram and said my lining looked a bit thick. I now also have to get both an endometrial biopsy done and a hysteroscopy. I don't mind doing the medical procedure itself. I am good with all that but it's just all the wait! I have been referred to her gyne colleague for the hysteroscopy but at this point, it's unclear how long I have to wait for that surgery since it's done in the OR and depends on the hospital's capacity. I live in Canada and surgeries are backlogged now due to the pandemic. And if there is a second wave, then who knows how long it'll actually be *sigh*

My other fear is that the biopsy might come back showing something more sinister like endometrial cancer as I know that's something to rule out when someone has a thickened lining. 

I have also been having weird cyclical rectal bleeding that would come on just before my period on day 1 of it which I read could be a sign of endometriosis. I forgot to bring this up to her but it's something in the back of my mind now and just another thing adding to my list of worries.

So even if IVF may be our next step, I don't even know when we'll finally start it. 

I'm worried it won't work, and then what? I'm worried that it'll be forever for us to conceive with IVF and then I won't be able to have a second child. I'm worried that my husband (who is not good with medical stuff) will become frustrated and tell me he doesn't want to do IVF anymore",t3_in014p

Because of that huge let down (even though I knew conceiving right off the bat was super naive of me to think lol) I started tracking ovulation. I finally got my 1st super + OPK (CD 25) so that would again put me at a 40 day cycle. 

Is there any information on if this is a good or bad thing/ if its nothing to worry about? My bf thinks that its because of him somehow lol (maybe it is?!

This time I got super faint lines at 14dpo and they got a little darker for a couple days, then lighter again. I didn’t even go to the doctor for this one. He put me on progesterone supplements following ovulation, so I have stopped taking that as of last night. 

Apparently we can make a baby, they’re just not sticking. I feel like the progesterone would help.

We have only been trying for about 2 weeks, and every morning the cramping starts. I've read that it may be typical to cramp during ovulation, but I havent even ovulated yet (I have a really long cycle).

I had my AMH checked via a blood test at my local fertility clinic in 2016 for £150, but they've since stopped offering it as a standalone test and now it's part of a £600 package. I can get the same test via this online company for £55, and they also do a day 3 hormone panel for £81.

I know I won't get the personalised consultation about the results, but I'm sure I could at least work out for myself a ballpark picture of what the figures suggest. 

Anyone have experience with an online testing lab, or know which are they most useful tests to get?

My background - my AMH was in the low satisfactory range at 35, and I got pregnant fine at 36 on the first try. I recently tried again and got pregnant on the second try but miscarried at 6 weeks. I have normal cycles and confirm ovulation by temping. We're now trying again, haven't been for long (first cycle didn't work out unsurprisingly), but I want to get ahead of the game, not wait 6 months to find out where I stand.

The only golden lining is that it does mean I’m able to get pregnant. However I’m now looking at my cycle history and I have cycles that vary from 33 days (shortest) to 60 days (longest) but seem to hover mostly between 35 and 42 days. I never really thought much of it but now after doing more research on PCOS I’m concerned I may be struggling with this. I made an appointment but I am not hopeful. I am constantly dismissed because “someone as young as yourself can’t be having fertility issues” which just makes me want to scream. I’m hoping this doctor will actually listen to me and take me seriously. I am hoping that perhaps clomid could help make it easier for me to conceive again by regulating my cycles and ovulation. 

Question: Is there anyone here who has been in a similar situation and gotten good results from clomid for regulating cycles and ovulation? If so, did you find that you experienced unwanted side effects from it? Am I reading into this too much and maybe I’ve just been unlucky and don’t need medical intervention at all?

283,TryingForABaby,"TW MISCARRIAGE.


I just really need to get this off my chest. I had a miscarriage on June 17th, 2020. My husband's step mother was incredibly condescending. We had told them that I was pregnant and miscarried at 7 weeks on fathers day, and she scoffed and said ""Well, were you *even trying*?"" And both he and i were incredibly hurt by her. The following weekend he went over to their house (which is a 2.5 hr drive, mind you) and she stuck to her guns, saying that she doesnt believe we're ready to be parents, and too many babies are born to parents who arent ready and then the babies are abused. So, in essence, she said that we would be terrible, abusive parents... and that was that - I cut off all communication since.

Fast forward to the past weekend, my husband tells me that it wasnt him they were worried about, that it was *me*! His father had told him these exact words that day: ""We arent worried about your abilities as a father, but we dont think she is ready to be a mother. I dont think she should have had the baby, she just doesnt have to ability to be a good mother."" 

How the FFFFFF do I deal with my relationship with them now? That bell cant be unrung. We are trying again, but I dont ever want them involved in my life again.

Hey ladies. (Or men). I’m new here. Im 27F My husband (37M) and I have been trying for baby #2 for six months. Last night I went to my gynecologist to discuss my options and my irregular cycle. The first thing he said was that it’s because I’m overweight. I’m 247 and 5’3. I know I need to lose weight. It’s always been a struggle for me. 

The only thing that really got me was that he went back through my history and proceeded to tell me how many pounds I’d gained within the past 7 years of going to their practice. That really made me feel down because it made me feel like a giant tub of lard!! 

I know he was not doing it to be mean, and I understand that, but I just feel like he didn’t discuss any other reasons as to why I’m irregular and not conceiving. He wants me to get bloodwork done to check my thyroid. He said if that looks good then I should start trying to lose weight &amp; look into fertility treatments.

Any words of advice, encouragement, or anything at all would be appreciated. I'm truly at a loss. 

My husband and I just got married a month ago and were planning on trying for kids very shortly thereafter. I was super looking forward to it as I've always wanted to be a mom, like many of you, and truly could not WAIT to start this new chapter of our lives. I lost my own mom at an early age and have been yearning for a mother-child connection for a very long time. So I took out my IUD, downloaded a pregnancy app, and consumed tons of pregnancy-related content in preparation for the exciting next step in our lives. 

Then it happened. Pain in my stomach that kept coming back every evening, and eventually showed up in the morning sometimes as well. I went to the doctor and they put me on a PPI (medication) which is helping, but sadly it means I can't try for a baby anymore for goodness knows how long. Maybe even forever if this condition doesn't get resolved (conceiving while on a PPI is a bad idea, as the chance of harming the baby goes up considerably). All of the medical tests I've done so far have come back normal, so there's no tangible explanation for the pain I am experiencing. 

I'm 33 years old and my husband is 40. To say I'm devastated is an understatement. I feel like my life and future have been robbed from me. I'm absolutely gutted, crying every night and wondering what the future holds. I also feel there isn't much more time for my husband and I to try for a baby as we're already somewhat older.

289,TryingForABaby,"From what I have read, implantation happens 6-12 days after ovulation (or conception, I’m thinking that happens at the same time if your egg is fertilized?)

So, does the body produce HCG after the egg is fertilized, before it implants? Because this isn’t making a lot of sense to me otherwise. 

If (hypothetically) I get an implantation 12 days after conception, I would already be at 12 DPO, how would I be able to get a positive pregnancy test at 9-10 DPO the way some women do? Does the Implantation spike HCG high enough to trigger a positive test immediately upon implantation? 

I see women on here at like, 15 DPO, wondering if they could still be pregnant, even though their tests are negative, and other women telling them “most likely not 🙁” 

I’m just wondering the science behind it. If the women who get implantation at 6DPO barely get a second line at 9-10 DPO, wouldn’t it take later-implanting women until 15-16 DPO to get the same faint line?",t3_imp27p

Partner (40F) and I (40M) are trying for our second but are intimidated by the 5% chance most commonly cited for advanced age. However, in a moment of clarity I remembered the binomial distribution from college statistics. With a 5% chance each month, trying every month in a year actually results in a 43% chance of at least one successful pregnancy.

Those numbers make us feel better. Wanted to share here to share a smile.

Try it yourself: enter 0.05 for p (probability of success on a single trial), 12 for n (number of trials), and 1 for x (number of successes). Set the dropdown to P(X ≥ x). The value in the red box is the probability of at least one pregnancy with 12 tries.

I'm hesitant to buy all the hormone testing kits to see if I'm ovulating, because I don't know how it would read. that's at least one consensus from the online material is that tehcnically after stopping depo you don't have to menstruate to ovulate, but I'm still on the fence on how to move forward with this.

302,TryingForABaby,"I posted here a couple weeks ago about how I was “bowing out for now” and my husband and I happily decided to wait to have a baby for a couple of years in order to enjoy the time we have together as a young couple, travel, and just do things that will be harder when we have kids. I have been off HBC since May 2018, and actively trying January-August (8 cycles). Nothing; we never got close to a positive pregnancy test. Back in April, I went to a reproductive specialist here and got an ultrasound and blood tests, and there was nothing wrong that they could see with me from that view. A lot of you mentioned and recommended that we continue to seek fertility treatment just to see what we were working with for when we do decide to start actively trying again. 

My husband went for a sperm analysis, and we got his results back a few days ago. It’s taken awhile to process it all. The results are not as bad as they could be, but they are not great. He is at the lower end of normal for count (26mil). Motility is great at 75%. Morphology was at a really low 2%. At the bottom of the results, it said “low morphology: suitable for IVF/ICSI” which was like a punch to the gut. I knew something was probably wrong, but seeing that we could be candidates for IVF was surprising. 

Our doctor is on leave for a few more weeks so we will have to wait for her to get back to make an appointment to discuss the results further and hear about what treatment options we have, or if IVF will be required based on his results. From what I’ve googled, low morphology can be improved with some different things that we are planning to try. We’re both going to be implementing some lifestyle changes to help as well. I guess this is a blessing in disguise; we wanted to wait awhile and now we know that we will have to spend likely a year+ improving things in our lifestyle and going to doctors appointments to try and improve his count and morphology. 

I know we’ve decided to wait, but this news has been really tough to swallow, and while I’m thankful our situation isn’t an end all be all and I don’t think it will be impossible to conceive naturally...I guess I’m just grieving the idea of getting pregnant quickly and without help or worry. I had always thought I would be one of those women who could say they got pregnant just from their husband looking at them. 

All this said, I really do feel thankful for this community and it’s encouragement. I wouldn’t have been so adamant to start fertility diagnosing and treatment if it weren’t for my last post and the comments you all made on it. It was a confusing conversation for my husband, to go from “let’s wait on having kids” to “we’re still waiting, but I need you to get that sperm analysis you’ve been delaying and we need to figure out what our fertility situation really looks like.” He’s really thankful (but disappointed) for the knowledge we have now too, and now has some motivation for changing certain factors of his lifestyle.

He said that they don’t do this procedure on women in their first or second trimester (local anaesthetic only) and that the recovery is about 5 days (though I read about 2 weeks). He didn’t really have any advice on timing TTC around this though. The earliest I can book the appointment is about one week before ovulation this cycle.

My original endo basically said ""well your symptoms fit so you have PCOS"" despite never having an ovarian cyst before. Since then, I've recently restarted the whole process with new doctors. My doctor called me Wednesday with my blood test results. 

She told me I don't have PCOS. All of the hormones she tested, like thyroid, estrogen, FSH and LH were all normal. However, I have high testosterone. I am aware of, and have read up on, the use of testosterone in IVF treatments and new research emerging on the affect testosterone has on ovulation and egg production. She referred me to an endocrinologist who will then make the decision whether it needs to be managed/treated in any way, but emphasized that my testosterone levels should *NOT* affect my ability to get pregnant. However, my cycle is still super irregular and I am in the doctors office every 4 months like clockwork because AF decided not to show and I have to take progesterone to force her to visit. 

When I was ttc in 2016, I was the only one going to doctors and trying to find out why I wasn't getting pregnant. Not once did my ex ever see or talk to a doctor. This was ultimately the nail in the coffin for that relationship and I ended it. It has been such a relief to know that I probably wasn't the cause of my infertility. 

My current partner has already gotten a referral to a urologist so he can get his swimmers tested, but due to covid it's taking longer than usual for the referral to go through. He and I both decided to make sure we were healthy and able to have children before actually starting ttc.

Anyone else dealt with this? How did you deal with it? What ended up working for you? Any advice or anecdotes are greatly appreciated.",t3_imo6jg
306,TryingForABaby,Instead I’m hoping AF arrives tomorrow. Ironically if we hadn’t canceled our postponed reception due to COVID-19 I’d be hoping AF held off a bit.

307,TryingForABaby,"So I got my results for my AMH blood test, but my appointment with the Fertility doc isn't till Sep 29th. I have long suspected I have PCOS, but have never had luck with getting some sort of diagnosis despite having many of the symptoms. My AMH levels are 11.37 ng/mL which according to the website below would indicate a high level for my age (32). Could my hunch about PCOS be right? Am I understanding my results correctly.

309,TryingForABaby,"This is my second cycle really paying attention to my fertility signs and symptoms, and I’ve noticed a pattern of barely any CM. I get a very small bit of sticky and creamy after my period and even into my ‘fertile window’. Even checking internally, it’s such a small amount for at least a week to a week and a half after my period ends.

For example, this is CD14 and I’m pretty much dry as a bone. I had my LH surge on CD18-19 last month and it was a similar pattern. 

Last month, I got some decent amounts of EWCM, but it was a few days after my LH surge. (I’m temping this month so I’ll know more about a more accurate ovulation date) It’s almost like my CM is behind schedule..

This month... 8dpo and I spotted again. 9 DPO and I woke up to what appears to be my period.

312,TryingForABaby,"Hi all! 
I have an appointment on 9/14 but was wondering if anyone has insight into my blood test result! 

CD3 Blood Test:

AMH 11.9 (higher than normal range)
Estradiol 35.6 (within range)
FSH 7.9 (within range)
Progesterone 0.34 (within range)
Prolactin 8.8 (within range)

After high AMH with CD3, my obgyn informed me that I might have PCOS and might need medication to induce ovulation. It came off as a shock to me as I have a pretty regular 31days cycle every month. I also don't have any PCOS symptoms other than maybe oily T zone on face and acne from time to time. But based on CD3 test result and going over bunch of related posts here and r/TTC_PCOS, I assumed I might have anovulatory regular cycle. 

CD24 Blood Test: I decided to take a break with OPK this month so not 100% sure if this is 7DPO but expect it to be based on my cycle length. 

Progesterone 12.1 (within range)

So just received a call that the progesterone level shows that I ovulate. So now I'm confused.

What should be the next steps? Should I get ultrasound to check the follicles to see if I might still have PCOS? Is it possible to have high AMH without PCOS?",t3_imjaqz
313,TryingForABaby,"I am currently NTNP but I've started getting disappointed every month and I'm looking in to options for maybe more active trying with partner soon or at least sorting my health and getting baseline recorded now I have been off BC a while charting has been discussed but I'm lazy and it sounds like it becomes an obsessive rabbit hole very quickly which for stress reasons I want to avoid 

Have found a few Fitbit type watch things that measure temp all day and wanted some thoughts 

one on Amazon was only 30$ and goes to 0.1 accuracy which from my basic understanding isn't enough accuracy really but it could maybe do the job and since it's skin temp it's not the best measurement yet again might do the job 

I'm thinking as a small cheap and lazy step up from NTNP before we start down the charting and timing rabbit hole might be a thing to start monitoring to get some idea of what's going on and how it all works in theory?

Me and BF have decided to try for a baby, I was on nexplanon for 3 years and had it removed on 3rd Aug this year. Had my period on the 11th Aug, standard and usual period no qualms. My period before this however, was a cycle length of 63 days (for context, my usual cycle is on the longer side, but was always irregular due to implant)... so now my ovulation timing is wrecked (I use Flo). I took OPK and got a spike on the 28th Aug (cycle day 18). Had sex, all good.

Now for the past 7 days I’ve had the worst sore boobs, horrible cramps and headaches. Light spotting last night but unsure if it was from sex (little bit rough) or if this is normal spotting post ovulation.

Now, when would I get an an accurate pregnancy test result? Tested this morning with clear blue 6 days early and negative. I know it’s probably too soon, but with my cycles being super vague and messed up I don’t actually know what day in my cycle I’d get a positive?",t3_imboyl

327,TryingForABaby,"So I went to my GP earlier this week to discuss not getting pregnant in our 6 months of trying. And I was so impressed. I already loved my GP because she listens and truly cares about her patients but I felt pretty decent. 

She talked about since my cycles are so wonky she’s referring me to the reproductive endocrinologist on staff who is apparently great (best in my city based on reviews online). She gave me options and let me make decisions. She was super sensitive to my feelings and really tried to make me feel better. We did a pap smear and decided to wait until I see the RE to do more of the testing based on where I am in this cycle (I was just about to ovulate on day 51). 

She also tried to make it clear that even though my cycle is wonky that we should still test my husband and so he’s going for a semen analysis. 

So all in all it was a great appointment. We’re making progress. We’re working on figuring out why we’re struggling and how we can expand our family. So I should be happy. And I guess I am. 

But there’s still this part of me that’s struggling. I’m currently seeing a therapist and we’re working through my feelings of being a failure but it’s hard not to feel like a failure when everyone around be got pregnant first go. 

I’m so appreciative of having such a great and supportive doctor and being referred to someone who sounds great and better able to help but I can’t help but feel down. I feel really alone here. My husband is great and supportive but I feel like I need a woman’s/person who can carry a baby’s experience. I can’t ask friends or family because they all got pregnant first try so they don’t really understand. 

It doesn’t help that I’m now in the two week wait.  And I want this so badly. I guess I’m just looking for advice or experiences of peoples’ referrals to REs after struggling for a while. Maybe I’m just looking for someone to help me feel less alone about this.",t3_im5prh

332,TryingForABaby,"Hi All,

This is my first time posting on this forum so please forgive me if this has been posted before. I'm not sure who else to talk to about this stuff- my poor husband is just as up and down about it as I am and none of my friends are trying to conceive so it's hard to get the support I'm seeking.

We have been trying since Nov '19 when I got my IUD out (Kyleena- 2 yrs) with no luck so far. I've been using two different apps to keep track of my cycle (Clue, Flo) and it appears I have a fairly regular period (generally 30 days long with a variation of about 3 days, usually shorter than longer). This month my cycle is 35 days and counting. I've taken three pregnancy tests (1 the day before my period was due, 1 the day after, and 1 today which is 2-4 days late depending how I count it) and all have been negative so far. I haven't missed a period since getting my IUD out and this seems very abnormal.

Earlier this month I got a blood test per my obgyn's suggestion to see if I had indeed ovulated. I went in on what I thought would be my ovulation day per my apps' calculation but my progesterone was low and did not confirm that I had even ovulated (though my Dr. says it is highly dependent on the day of the month). I'm discouraged that I may be 1) getting my ovulation time completely wrong every month and 2) may not be ovulating at all??? But if that's the case why have my periods been so regular?

I am confused, sad, angry, a little relieved... a lot of feelings. I have been cramping mildly for days and have had unusual amounts of gas even before eating anything for the day. No nipple soreness or color changes, but definitely some food aversion (though that may just be my mood). Two days ago I had a terrible hormonal day where I literally cried for the entire day and thought ""ok well that must be the period coming"" but nope! No period.

I cannot really cope with not knowing if I will ever conceive. My husband is always so optimistic and I feel terrible being such a downer. I can’t even watch TV without saying “I wish we had a baby” if someone on TV has a baby, or kids. It’s super unhealthy. I hate it. I can’t walk past parents with kids or strollers without getting really down.

I’ve tried so many things, so many hobbies, so many vitamins, exercise... nothing helps. It’s all made worse by the fact our doctor has been stringing us along the whole time. Saying they’ll get the ball rolling on tests, semen analysis etc and then...not.

When I started this journey 11 cycles ago, I went into it feeling positive. I have 'perfect' cycles every month. 28 to 30 days, ovulate between day 14 and 16. I take OPKs and my temperature, I can see my body doing everything right every month. 

On cycle 10 I thought we hit jackpot. Two beautiful pink lines in one test is all I've wanted to see since late last year. Then the dream shattered and I realised I was going through a CP. It was painful physically and emotionally. This month though I felt cocky, because I KNEW, my body could do it now. At least the first part of it. I was so obnoxious I even started making a list of maternity clothes and baby items. These two last weeks I have been feeling like it would happen again, I would finally be pregnant and it would be a sticky one!

Is it bad that at this point I'm just waiting for the clock to run down so I can get to the doctors? I have no enthusiasm to try anymore. I'm tired of POAS for majority of the month (either being OPK or HCG). I'm sick of waking up at 7.30 in the morning every day to take my temperature, even on Sundays when I could just sleep in.

I'm just done.
End of rant. You may continue with your day.",t3_ilq0qe
348,TryingForABaby,"Hi Everyone!

I started taking my BBT this morning for the first time. I know you’re supposed to take it around the same time every morning (or exactly same time if disciplined) and after 3 hours of sleep. I often wake up at night and fall asleep quickly so my sleep is restless about half the nights. This morning I took my BBT at 5:30 when I restlessly woke up and it was 97.14 and promptly fell back asleep. When my alarm went off at 7, I figured I’d see the difference. It was 97.44. 

If I normally wake up at 7, should I just keep track of that later time instead of my restless times (but that restless time does have 3 solid hours of sleep before it)? I’m not disciplined to wake myself up twice each day haha. At least not at this point.

Thanks for your help!",t3_ilu7pn
349,TryingForABaby,"Since I've had the opportunity to overanalyze every cycle since last year /s, I've really noticed the instant hormonal change in the luteal phase. I swear the second I ovulate I get a constant tense feeling in my stomach that I just cannot relax and let go of. My anxiety is definitely heightened, my brain is on a constant loop of thoughts, I'm irritated, constantly hungry, my knees hurt like an old woman, and I have to pee every 2 hours. I've also given up even decaf coffee in the luteal phase because it especially bothers my stomach.

I've read that this is all related to the fluctuations of estrogen and progesterone but could be a sign of low progesterone. I want my progesterone tested but my doctor was very dismissive so I'll wait until my yearly appointment. My brain is stuck on this cycle of 'I can't get/stay pregnant because im too tense, but I'm too tense because my progesterone is low, but stress also causes low progesterone, and I can't get tested for low progesterone because my doctor will treat me like a hypochondriac and charge me $80"". 

Anyone else feel like this? Especially the tense feeling?",t3_im0a1t
350,TryingForABaby,"Edit:

Thanks y'all! I've been dealing with this for over a year. I've been low carb and next to no sugar since March. I've done all the PH balancing things (cotton undies only, changing them often, showering after exercise, no soap, probiotics, adding fermented foods, which has helped, but still lingering). 
Finally getting in to see a fertility specialist next month. I know most people with recurrent BV/PH issues suggest boric acid but I was hesitant so I decided to give this a whirl before seeing him.
Thanks again!

This is what it says about the vaginal probiotics I'm taking to help balance my PH:
""IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE SEX DURING VAGINAL PROBIOTHERAPY ?

Yes, but you have to wait after the relationship to start the daily treatment of Probaclac Vaginal.""

Uhh.. so does that mean I can still have sex but just don't put the probiotic in until after I have sex?? Like.. obviously?? Or does it mean something else? What is up with this weird ass phrasing!",t3_ilrvgk

353,TryingForABaby,"I’m 27 next month and my fiancé is 29. I have no children, my partner has 2 from his previous relationship. I was officially diagnosed in July with PCOS after blood tests and ultrasounds as we had been TTC since February. I had years of irregular periods, hair growth and the typical “PCOS belly”. I was then put on 1500mg of extended release metformin. 

First cycle on Metformin was 28 days after my LMP. I was so excited thinking we were finally able to start tracking properly. Then second cycle was 26 days. Confusing but we could work with it. Both cycles I had stark white OPKs, no second line. So no idea if I actually ovulated. I’m now on day 31, no period in sight, not a single PMS or pregnancy symptom. I’ve had negative HPTs however have consistently been getting 2 faint lines on OPKs for the last 2 weeks. But they’re quite light and definitely not “peaks”. Hopefully my body figures out what’s its doing ASAP. And everyone keeps saying “oh just relax it will happen when you’re not thinking about it” but that’s very easy for those who have multiple children already or are so fertile they get pregnant on BC.",t3_ils5ci

355,TryingForABaby,"I'm on my 2nd medicated IUI cycle (Menopur 75, Ovidrel trigger, progesterone), 12 DPO (CD 25) and just got light bleeding, not spotting. This is when I would normally get my period if I were unmedicated. Last IUI cycle, I got spotting 10 DPO and then AF on 13 DPO (CD 29). 

I normally have a short luteal cycle, approx 6-8 days, so probably low progesterone (though they didn't test for that). My RE said all the drugs would override any luteal phase issue. However, this cycle, I'm falling into my regular pattern. Could be the full moon, haha... 

Has this happened to anyone doing IVF/IUI taking progesterone? Any insights? Going to speak with a nurse on the phone, but curious to get this sub's wisdom!

p.s. -- I posted occasionally to this sub and other reproductive subs under a different username, but I accidentally shared (phone bouncing around in my purse) an embarrassing post with my blood test results to my business Facebook page.

358,TryingForABaby,"Hi all. Cycle 5 novice over here. The last three cycles I have been tracking I would get significant symptoms leading up to ovulation and then extending through until a day or two before AF— breast pain, bloating, nausea. I have always gotten a clear LH surge that was fairly quick. 

This cycle, I have had none of those symptoms. I did get a really clear LH surge on CD 19 (usually 16-17 in pts cycles, so not far from the norm). Now CD 21 and still no symptoms.

Anyone have anything like this but still actually ovulate?

359,TryingForABaby,"So I have weird cycles thanks to PCOS. They are typically 35-40 days long. Well I just started taking meds for my Thyroid and the drs think that could be what’s triggering the PCOS and once I get it under control with the meds I should start having normal cycles again. So I started tempting this month, mid month, around CD 15, but since my cycles are typically longer I figured if I ovulate it would be around CD 18-21. Based on my temps I thought that was happening. But this morning my temp jumped again and I had a little spotting and now I have no clue what’s going on because it’s now CD 29. Am I getting my period on time? Is it ovulation bleeding? I also have some light cramping so that’s not helping either lol. So now I’m waiting to see what the next few days bring lol. Luckily it’s only cycle 1 with 0 expectations and if it is my period at least it’s on time I guess 🤷‍♀️ lol",t3_ilrkg2
360,TryingForABaby,"I have a call in to my dr but they usually don't return calls until the end of the day. 

My LMP was Aug 6th. On day 3 I started taking 5mg Aygestin to keep my lining thin for my hysteroscopy/polypdectomy which was yesterday. The dr said to take Aygestin for 3 more days and then I'd get a period around Sunday and could start my planned next cycle (monitored cycle with Femara).

However, it would be much more convenient for me to wait a week since we're going out of town for Labor Day. Has anyone had experience using Aygestin or other hormonal b.c. to adjust your cycle start date?",t3_iluxxo
361,TryingForABaby,"So just to clarify, I feel fairly confident in how the process works on paper: Wait to ovulate, do the baby dance, wait the 2 weeks or so, and take a pregnancy test. But this is proving to be a lot more detailed than we were expecting. For example, I've only been off BC for a little over a week now. I've heard different stories about people who got pregnant as soon as they got off BC, and for others when it took a little while. I took an OPK (Am I even using that term right?) last night, but it was negative, so I decided to take another one this morning. The lines were equally blue, so my husband and I had sex. But is that it? Do I need to follow up or do anything to help the process? I've seen some of the posts on here, and you all seem so sure of what you're doing and know all the steps. I just hope I'm doing everything correctly. I have an appointment with my OB/GYN later this month to follow up with her and make sure I'm on the right track.

So of course I googled it and it’s an early pregnancy symptom.

367,TryingForABaby,"Two friends due end of September/ early October. One due around Christmas. Another just announced and due in February. I haven’t cried today about it..... yet. Currently on cycle 7 and have an appointment with an RE in two weeks. I never imagined trying to get pregnant to be so full of tears, heartache, and sadness. I always imagined this time to be magical and it has been anything but for the last coupe of months. I know 7 months isn’t a super long time
but knowing the statistics that 80% have conceived by now and having so many people around that are pregnant makes this so tough. Add on top of it that husband may have trouble with his sperm due to a medical occurrence at birth, just adds so much more worry to this whole experience. Hence why we are going to see an RE a bit earlier than typical. Just needed to vent to a community that would understand. No one knows we are trying so my husband and I don’t have anyone else to lean on besides ourselves",t3_ileqs6
368,TryingForABaby,Honestly I’m so broken. Over the weekend i got 3 positive test and I said finally it’s been a long journey. Went to get a blood test and it turned out to be a chemical pregnancy. Same day doctor was going to tell me results my period came which made me break down. So I had a whole day to myself in bed. Today I feel much better but I’m wondering if I’m doing too much because I feel sad about this. In two weeks I will be going to take another blood test to follow this chemical pregnancy to 0 and start clomid medication.,t3_ilceae

I'm on clomid as the DH has low morph (whereas I got an ""all good""), so basically it was 'making more targets for them swimmers to hit'. 

AF is due for tomorrow (again, assuming clomid didn't mess up my cycles), and I'm super nervous. On the one hand, I really REALLY wanna know if it's a BFP, but on the other hand, I just.... I don't know if I could handle it being another negative. I'll be turning 30 at the end of the month, and my ""life plan"" was to be at least pregnant by 30. This is basically my ""last"" chance. I could probably fit the next cycle in as well (as the testing days would *juuuuust* fall in where I *might* be able to test right before/on my birthday, but, I dunno.

371,TryingForABaby,"I stopped taking the pill in february/march, and for the first few months we were not actively TTC. My boyfriend needed time to be completely sure, and we started TTC in may, I think? As the title says, I was really trying to take it easy and kept telling my bf that since my mother had problems with concieving, I might too, so he has to be patient. Fast forward three months and I have lost my cool to say the least...  (He is still very patient and supporting). In may I discovered that my cycle is actually five weeks long. I started taking the pill at a young age bc of massive menstrual pain, so I never got to know my cycle. Im on CD35 and 15 days PO. Im not pregnant, and my digital clearblue ovulation kit really screwed me. It showed positive results for over a week (of course I imagined it meant I was pregnant, lol). When I felt that I ovulated it was later than expected (Day 20) and we were actively TTC from maybe CD 8-16 (I was away on a trip after this). Im angry at myself for not learning enough about my body and cycle earlier, and im angry because my cycle is so long that it will be another three weeks before we can try again. I really thought trying multiple times a day from CD 8-16 would do the trick (like it would magically work bc we did it «right», because thats how reality works... or not). I know I will get all excited and have symptoms next month too, but this might take time. And time moves slowly right now. At least I know now that my OD is much later than I thought.

372,TryingForABaby,"Been TTC #1 for 6 months (I’m 32 F). I’ve tried tracking ovulation with an app and using OPK’s (cheapies and non cheapies). For a couple months I used them every day, at times twice a day when I expected to be in a fertile window.

My question is... does anyone know why I have never had an actual positive? I’ve noticed a faint second line a few times but it never gets to the point of being an actual positive. I’ve even noticed a faint line more than once a cycle but during totally different times (like a faint line, then nothing, then a faint line like a week later). My OB said she thinks my first faint line could be considered a positive, but from what I’ve seen on all OPK directions it needs to be more than just an inkling of a line. 

My cycles are on the short side (19-24 days) and light periods. Some random spotting sometimes for a day or two throughout the cycle. At times I get random “pangs” which I’ve thought could be ovulation pains, but never a positive OPK for sure.

373,TryingForABaby,"Let me start this off by saying that I’m a 20 year old female so I’m very aware it COULD just be a matter of time, but I digress. 

My boyfriend (22) and I have been having unprotected sex for a full year— almost daily. At first I was very uncertain about the idea of having a baby, solely for the pain during birth and the postpartum. More recently though, I’ve sort of changed my mind. My mother is absolutely amazing, the strongest woman I know; she raised four kids by herself and did a wonderful job. In a way, looking back on it made me flip the switch, and now I think (since my friends are now gradually conceiving) I’m more prepared for it. The only problem is that we can’t. 

My periods are regular and last about five days per month (save for this last month as I was extremely stressed, and as a result, missed it entirely.) I’m not sure how my hormones are, despite the occasional single long hair under my chin (which I’ve been told by a few people could mean PCOS but I don’t want to diagnose myself.) My cramps, however, are extremely painful (and by that I mean incredibly unbearable.), to the point where I shovel Motrin and Tylenol and probably damage my body. I’m not overweight; I’m 5’6” and about 130-135 pounds. 

I’m disheartened by the fact that nothing has happened despite it being over a year. It makes me feel like I will never be able to have a baby. It genuinely crushes my soul when I’m on social media or watching TV and I see people with their babies and kids. My whole life I’ve never wanted to have one, go figure that the moment I do, it seems impossible.

I want to get seen by an OBGYN but I have no medical insurance and not enough money to spend to get seen. I don’t know what to do anymore. Any advice? Thank y’all in advance.",t3_ilxucn
374,TryingForABaby,"So, just a few days ago I posted here absolutely elated that we were going to start TTC this month. Queue husband now taking it back and saying that we would start TTC in December because that's when HE wants to start trying. Now, let me note that there is absolutely no reason that he has for TTC in December vs now. I have been wanting to have a baby for the last 4 years and have been as patient as I possible could be while waiting for him to catch up.

We were originally going to start TTC in August, but we had just moved into our first house in June and wanted time to adjust and so on and so forth. Then, I made the mistake of giving it a timeline of effing December and now my husband makes it sound like I'm trying to force him into a pregnancy, even though I only want to start trying 3 months early. If I would have said September, he would be fine with it, but I said December. He's so unwilling to budge now. I feel like he's going to pull the same crap in December...

In my mind, 3 months is not a far stretch and he should be willing to make a compromise considering our initial timeline was last month. He said he just wants three additional months to keep being lazy before I get pregnant and have to worry about appointments, making sure I'm eating well, etc., etc. We both have decent jobs, we own one of our cars outright and will pay the other one off soon, we have no CC debt. We joke around with each other a lot, but sometimes the jokes can be hurtful. For example:

- ""If we have a child we will probably end up living on the streets."" This is coming from someone who has a master's degree, is working in a place where he has had ample growth, and is currently working on his PhD, which is being 90% reimbursed from the company we both work for.
- ""What if our child wants to go to New Zealand for a trip with his friends when he is 17?"" We'll have 17 years to plan for that
- ""If you get pregnant prior to December, it will be because of you putting me on a guilt trip"" WTF is 3+ months?? It's probably going to take us 3 months to conceive anyway. I don't guilt trip either. I have conversations with him about it and every time I do he changes the subject.

After our first year of unsuccessful trying, we went to our GP to get referred for free fertility tests with the NHS. We were both told that everything is normal, to keep trying naturally, and therefore we wouldn’t be eligible for the 3 free rounds of IVF through NHS. 


A year later of no success still, we finally decided to just pay the £515 to get private testing at our local fertility clinic. They immediately notified us that I have a low ovarian reserve (which I was told is unusual for someone aged 29), while my partner’s sperm sample had only 3% morphology (the minimum normal-ish value is 4% apparently!). 


While on one side we were upset that the NHS had not spotted and notified us of this (although they are understandably very busy and are still very swift and diligent), on the other hand we’re both happy that these test results can now get us a referral for 3 free IVF rounds! In the meantime while we’re on the waitlist for a couple of months, we’ll keep trying naturally as the private consultant did point out that I may be ovulating a lot earlier than what the Clue app is calculating. (This one is a bit weird, as I get my ovulation discharge and ovulation bleeding exactly at the time the app predicts, but when I had my blood test, two days before calculated ovulation, it showed that I had already ovulated...?

Anyway, I just wanted to say hello and ask the others with PCOS how long we should give things before seeing the gyno about Clomid or even IVF?

395,TryingForABaby,"I’ve been lurking here for a while, but this is my first post. Hope I’m doing this right!
My husband and I have been TTC #1 for 3 cycles. I’ve been using the touch screen Clearblue Fertility Monitor and Easy@Home strips. I  tried to track BBT prior to TTC but didn’t seem reliable due to waking up frequently during the night- so haven’t tracked this cycle.
CBFM identified estrogen rise on 8/17 (CD11), and peak fertility on 8/23-8/24 (CD17-18). Easy@Home strips identified peak fertility on 8/25 (CD19), but I haven’t seen my LH levels drop since then. Link to ovulation tests here: https://imgur.com/a/jgjVZjB

398,TryingForABaby,"Hi, new here. I’ve been off the pill and tracking my periods/opk since March. I had two periods immediately after the pill right around 30 days. My third cycle was 53 days, and now I’m cd35. 

Premom showed my peak at 1.65 last month and I confirmed with BBT. 

This month on cd23 it raised to .54 and my temp went up the next day. Cd26 it raised again to .65 but my temp dropped a bit/went back to baseline. Then cd31 raised yet again to .73 (temp stayed low) and finally up to .88 on cd 32. 

Obviously the strips will vary depending on my water intake and such, but the fact that even the “peaks” were still significantly lower than lost month worries me a little. 

In my early 20s I tried to have a baby for almost two years. It turns out that was a blessing in that relationship, but years later I’m now married, ready, and very impatient. Lol my doctor knows I have a history of cysts but told me my hormone levels are normal and even though I have many symptoms, I “likely don’t have PCOS because I’m not overweight.” Yes, my doctor said that.

I’ve been TTC since last October. I have a decent twitter following, and wanted to be open about my journey, to help others, but every time I would talk about it I would get flooded with unwanted advice. This advice gave me anxiety and sometimes even made me angry. So I decided to stop sharing my journey. I wish people would realize, it is not a good idea to think you know enough about a total stranger (or honestly, even a family member or friend!) to give them advice about something so sensitive! I have an auto-immune disorder, “just relax and don’t worry about it and then it will happen” is useless and basically just telling me it is all my fault for being upset when I get my period every month!!! And if I hear one more “I ate *this* every day and then I got pregnant”... good for you, truly!! But I don’t want my fate to be determined by green smoothies or pounds of blueberries or ghee or whatever. These people act like they know all about my sex life and all about my medical history and they know what it is I haven’t tried and what it is I don’t know. Even have had people try to explain ovulation to me!!! I know unwanted advice is going to come up in every chapter of my life. I know when (if) I get pregnant, people will see my bump as an invitation to spout nonsense about that, too. But at least then I’ll have the comfort of knowing, I’m going to have a baby. Right now it just feels like strangers yelling nonsense at me while I crumble buying yet another box of tampons. Even when it is people I love, I have told them please ask me if I am in the mood for advice before giving me advice because I’m very sensitive right now. At least most of them listen to that. I know it hasn’t even been a year yet and some of you have been trying SO long so maybe I’m sounding silly for being so upset about everything already, but some of my first memories are playing with dolls, dreaming of being a mommy. I have been waiting for this literally my whole life. And I don’t think the secret is “just eat a lot of cheese!” EVERYBODY SHUT UP!!

In the meantime, I wanted to start to figure out whether I’m ovulating. My PCP recommended using the clear blue digital OPK, which I started about a week ago. Day 1 was empty, and now days 2-7 have all had flashy smiley faces. Since I started testing so late in this cycle, can someone walk me through what this means/could mean? I have been having daily wet CM, but that’s also a bit hard to track because we BD every other day since my cycle is so long and we don’t know when I’m ovulating.

0. tracking my cycle on an app and seeing I'm in the ""fertile window""

1. sex
2. waiting until it's been long enough I can take a pregnancy test
3. getting impatient and testing too early and getting a negative
4. convincing myself that the negative is only because I didn't wait long enough
5. getting a little bit of spotting the day before my period is scheduled to arrive
6. convincing myself it's ""implantation bleeding"" and that it doesn't mean I'm not pregnant
7. fully believing I'm pregnant because I'm clearly delusional and even though I've gone through this exact set of steps like 5 times already I still don't learn to see it for what it is
8. waking up the next day to a full-blown period and being completely let down
9. getting depressed and binging on chocolate and ice cream for 4 days

We have went through 3 rounds of meds and timed intercourse and then 1 round of iui. Now in those scenarios they tell you exactly when to have intercourse. Well typically in a month the husband and I have sex 5-6 times a month. 3 being around positive OPK and the others typically leading up to fertile week. The reason I am wondering about this is my close friend who had been having a difficult time getting pregnant with her second baby after a loss last year finally got pregnant. I asked her what she did different this month just to get some insight. She had been taking supplements and OPK tests. Thats something I do every month. Then I decided to ask how many times they would have intercourse around ovulation. She said her typical amount was maybe 10-15 times a month and usually every day during her fertile week. Mind blown! So I just wanted to see where everyone else kind of is. I am really curious to see if we should bump our numbers up. I mean I know it can't hurt our chances, but overall I am curious.

This is insane and I’m at my wits end. I don’t know if I should continue to try naturally because at least it’s free or pay all this money for 1 try at a medicated cycle at least. Nothing seems like the right answer when you’ve been trying this long.

Yes my OPKs are doing the right things but can I even make a baby? I have alot of anxiety over this.

Anyway, I'm struggling with seeing others around me getting pregnant or showing off baby pictures. What doesn't help is im a Sonographer and have been getting ALOT more 1st trimester dating lately.. majority of them younger than me. I've been getting better with managing my emotions but today got me. A good friend of mine who is also a coworker revealed she's pregnant and its unexpected. She is happy about it but understandably shocked. Im okay with it, my emotions are somewhat in check but I'm still disheartened its not me. 

Long story short I told my husband why im sad and he just doesn't get it, he thinks it's silly. I have tried explaining that I struggle with seeing others around me experiencing something I want so bad and its worsened by the thoughts that I may never get to experience that. Its a source of tension between us because he doesn't understand why I feel this way and I dont know how to explain it any differently. Even though we are 2 weeks from actually trying I still have the same feelings.

I verbalized this fear a couple of weeks ago to my husband that they would tell us they were pregnant while were still quietly struggling to conceive. 

I know that I could tell her but.. I’m just really excited for her reaction to when announce a baby that I don’t want to spoil it, if that makes sense. 

I’m just feeling sad. I want to be pregnant so bad and haven’t had a hint of it happening for us and it was just really hard to be excited for them and simultaneously hide my pain.",t3_ikzc7i
416,TryingForABaby,"So about a month and a half after we first saw (by saw I mean phone call because of covid) the fertility specialist after 6 months of trying we finally have answers. Basically everything on my side is totally normal except hypothyrodism and my husband has less than 1million sperm and normal, but slightly low testoterone. The doctor gave us the choice of jumping into IVF or waiting to see a urologist and seeing if they can help out my husband since there may be something (he didn't say what) he can do.   


The doctor kept calling me ""young"" and said I have time to wait to see if they can help out my husband, which I think is a joke because I'm 32.5 and want more than 1, and more than hopefully two kids.   I feel like I'm already so late to the game!There is also no guaruntee the urologist can help my husband and even getting an appointment will likely take 4 months.   


He put us on the free IVF list but that takes a year or longer. I'm considering just paying whatever it costs in the hope of getting pregnant sooner.   


At least now I know why with regular cycles and ovulating every cycle and a previous good AMH test I haven't been able to conceive in 9 cycles yet, especially since my mom just had to try once to have all my siblings.  


Moral of the story? Go to a specialist sooner rather than later and force your husband to take a sperm test even if they are resistant. Male factor is a full 30-40% of infertility issues.  


I feel....confused and annoyed. I always said I'd never do ICSI IVF and just accept my fate but I never ever considered that I wouldn't be the problem! Funny how the universe does that. I find IVF for male factor pretty sexist; they're taking a perfectly healthy female and putting her through medication and everything.

This cycle was my second round of Clomid. My dr will only give me Clomid for 3 months. I’m in my fertile window now (I will likely ovulate tomorrow) and sex for the last 3 days has not ended the way we want it to. 

I brought up at home insemination with him this morning as a way to still cover our bases without him feeling pressured during sex because we were both very upset this morning when it didn’t work out. So this evening we did our first at home insemination! But we have no idea what we’re doing! I bought an oral syringe, injected the fluid into myself, inserted a menstrual cup, had a couple orgasms, then laid with my hips up for about 30 minutes

We might keep trying this. Any tips for what we could have done differently? How long do I keep the cup in? How long is it good for after production before insertion?

I do feel like I have been pretty good about BD, and I guess thought this would happen at the drop of a hat like it did for all of my friends, so I'm looking for some more advice. Currently I'm using Pregmate OPK (see images) to attempt to find my O date. I use pre-seed, don't take my temp yet, and have been getting consistent about BD every other day. This month was the most successful so fingers crossed. 

What should I be doing more of? If it doesn't work out this month, I think I'll start taking my temp, get a clear blue tracker, and really tune in on my diet and everything that's in my control. Here are my charts from the past months I have tracked. Any advice is appreciated.

Since coming off of BCP in July 2019, I have had cycles between 29-46 days. (Though it seems like 29 - 39 is where my range is actually landing). I know that irregular cycles can be a symptom of PCOS. I also have a slightly elevated AMH (6.9) and have hormonal acne. But I don't have polycystic ovaries or high testosterone. 

Anyways - just feeling frustrated with trying to figure out my cycle and timing BD for TTC. (I use OPKs, trying to track CM but am still learning, and I don't temp.) I'm fairly low libido and this process is stressful!",t3_ikphec
439,TryingForABaby,"Hi all,

We're going to start ttc in late December, I took my first folic acid dose today (and will be looking into folate too following previous advice from this sub).

I know advice in my country (UK) is more or less to stay away from vitamin A when pregnant/actively trying, but should I be ok to continue taking my regular multivitamin and using retinols until December? Then make the switch to specialist prenatals if doctor advised? Or is there a risk of build up? 

A lot of stuff I'm finding is directed solely at the point of ttc and the risks to existing pregnancies. Would appreciate any wisdom/experience.

441,TryingForABaby,"Rant ahead!

I'm struggling a lot at the moment. My husband and I have been TTC since we got married in March. In order to prep for trying I stopped taking the pill (cerazette progesterone only pill) and I did routine bloods with my doctor. My tsh came back at 9.8. I was put on eltroxin 50mg and retested 5 weeks later and it had gone down to 4.6. My doctor felt that was still high so upped my dosage to 50/75mg and I was retested 8 weeks later. This time my tsh was 46.2!! I was retested the next day and it went up to 59.4 overnight. My dosage was put up to 100mg and I was retested last week and thankfully it's back down to 5.81. This is still too high so I'm on 125mg daily now. While this is happening, I still haven't had a period. It's been nearly 6 months and it just feels like it's never going to come. I can't track anything and I'm just so frustrated. 

I have a history of gynae issues. Several years of pain during sex, bleeding etc. I had lapryscopic surgery querying endo last year, which was clear, but instead they found enlarged veins around my uterus (possibly pelvic congestion syndrome). I'm awaiting an appointment with an endocrinologist to keep an eye on my hypothyroidism but I'm wondering if I should be going to a different specialist? Anyone with experience in a similar situation? I know it's still early days and we've only been trying for a few months but I can't help feeling so frustrated.",t3_iksgr9
442,TryingForABaby,"Hi all! Quick question for you all. I know cycles after coming off hbc can be a little weird but have any of you experienced this before...

I stopped the pill July 14 and ovulated on CD 21 on that cycle. Right now I’m currently in my first “real” cycle since I got my first real period a few weeks ago. I got a dye stealer today on my opk, CD 15. Last cycle the positive was pretty sudden, this cycle I could gradually see it getting darker and today it hit 2.22 on the Premom app, last cycle it was only 1. something at its peak! So basically, do your cycles get shorter and shorter the longer you are off hbc? Before hbc I had 28 day cycles and that first one was 35. If I have a 14 day luteal period I’ll get my period on CD29. 

Also, this is based on opks not temps, first cycle I effed up my temps in fertile week and for this one I didn’t get the spike yet, I’m thinking it will come tomorrow if I am in fact ovulating.",t3_iko2dh

Hello again fellow TTCers. I hope all is well and you guys smile today 💕🤞🏼 


   I'm just gonna jump right in with my uterus problems bc I'd like some advice if anyone has gone through something similar when they started TTC. 

   So, I feel like our first month of TTC was robbed from me and my SO. When we got together [9mo] and started intimacy regularly, I became regular. (prior I was having No sex for a couple years and my period was few and far between if it even happened but if it did it hurt like hell) However our ""first"" month started after my June 16th period was done. I missed my July period and August. No solid peaks in Ovulation strips. I did stop doing them daily however I've started again. I've got some tools to help me temp as well. 


But here's my issue(s) early August (no pinpointed day) I had the ever so slightest spotting. Maybe TMI but mine are usually very heavy and a regular tampon or pad runs away in fear. I immediately got excited and thought AF was on her way. Nope. Just spotting. More spotting. and.....more spotting. as I'm typing this I'm currently spotting still. I've gotten some advice that I should treat this as a period. I'm trying but spotting for a full or at minimum a bit more than 2 weeks is not making sense to me. 


My second issue; BBTing. So for this one, it's weird. I live in a state that sees triple digit temperatures for the weather. I have a swamp cooler. (And a refrigerated air one room cooler unit for the bedroom, thank you FMIL) I work (from home) at 6 a.m, SO is a truck driver is is out by 5:30 a.m - 6 a.m so I'm usually awake or waking up at 5 a.m. I wake up around 2 or 3 to pee. I dont know if that matters. 
Anyways. When I wake up The air around me is ice cold however I'm sweating. If I take off my blanket I'm shivering and sweating. It last for about an hour or so then I'm normal as if I woke up normally. SO wakes up perfectly fine l. Can I get accurate temps like this? Will the weird temps that cause me to feel both cold and hot give me inaccurate results for the thermometer? Or since it's my BASEal body temp should I just take the temp anyways? How should I go about BBT and the spotting? 


   I am 100% aware that I (clearly) have not been in this journey as long as some have, but I feel like I'm failing as a woman and my SO. I can't even seem to ovulate... my periods don't come. I'm not sure where to go from here. Being an Empath and a severe Overthinker doesn't mix well with TTC from what I've experienced so far. And expensive bc with overthinking comes a POAS addiction lol well thank you for making it this far. I appreciate your time and reply if you feel like replying or offering any advice. I hope we all get positives soon 💕 



Thanks again. k bye.",t3_iknlag

454,TryingForABaby,"Hello ladies!

Im on my 2nd month TTC. 
https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/Azzybum

This month I believe I ovulated on CD15 (still need 2 more temps to confirm) a positive OPK on CD 14.
I had sex CD13 late in the night (that morning my OPK was negative and in the evening I had a strong reading on my OPK)

Next day, CD14 I had positives morning and night but didn't have sex that evening.

CD15, had sex about 9am. My temp at 7am was low and I checked another OPK and it was negative. So I believe i ovulated somewhere that night.

Is having sex on the suspected day of ovulation any good? Do you think I may have caught the egg still since it has to travel a bit? Can someone explain the temp drop, does it mean the egg has already been released or going to be released that day? I know the temp rise thr following day confirms the egg is out and a corpus luteum has formed but that's a whole 24 hour window!

I feel it sucks we can only temp once a day!",t3_ikkert

I went to the gyno for a preconception appointment (they did blood work, provided guidance and said i was ready to get off birth control). I've been on birth control for \~12years. For the last 8 i've specifically used the patch as my birth control of choice. I took my patch off and had my first period. I bought the LH strips and started testing, as i have no clue how long my cycle is I didn't want to miss possible signs of ovulation. I never saw a positive with the LH strips. I'm now on CD34 with no feelings that my period is coming on. I've taken multiple pregnancy test, and thats a no. I started temping on CD27 and have seen that my temp is increasing daily (possibly a sign that my AF is coming).

....and only gotten negative tests. 

My husband doesn't believe the tests because of how i feel but Im sure im not. I think i made myself have symptoms by thinking about it too much. Hes so excited, adding things to the baby stuff amazon list my friend made me when I told her we were trying. He got drunk and put his hand on my belly and told me he can't wait to meet them. 



Its just really sad and I guess I just want people to tell me its not my fault that i have to break his heart when my period starts or I have to go to the doctor to see whats wrong now.

465,TryingForABaby,"We aren't very far into actively trying. I know it's super early in the process. But this is an anxiety I thought I was over and it's rearing it's head in an ugly way now.

I know my parents struggled to conceive at first. It took them years of trying to have their first child. Some of that was possibly due to endometriosis but for the most part it was unexplained infertility. I also have endometriosis. When I was 14, my OBGYN at the time told me (while refusing to do any actual testing!) I most likely had a severe case and would struggle to have kids if I could get pregnant at all. That statement has stuck with me more than I ever thought. Since then I've gotten a new OBGYN who actually did some testing and removal. My case is not nearly as severe as my first doctor led me to believe but I simply can't shake the fear that I'll never be able to get pregnant. My husband's job also makes it very difficult for us to actively TTC for a year straight and insurance won't cover any infertility treatments until we've done so. I know the only thing to do is keep trying but I hate this feeling of doom that's just hanging over my head.",t3_ikired
466,TryingForABaby,"I had an ectopic pregnancy almost 2 years ago with no success in conceiving since then. My OBGYN ordered blood work and an HSG to scope out my tubes. I was not looking forward to the HSG so I put it off for 9 months. Since I did have an ectopic treated without surgery I was fully expecting to have some issues with my tubes. 

My experience: 

HSG scheduled for CD9 at a local-ish hospital. I was given no special instructions and was just told to show up. After taking a urine pregnancy test and getting changed into a gown I climbed up on a flat table with an X-ray device above me. I had to lay back with my knees bent while the doctor used a speculum and cleaned my cervix. So far the procedure is feeling like a Pap smear. The dye was then inserted and I could feel it move through me. It was a weird sensation. My body was tense and uncomfortable but at no point would I describe it as painful. The radiology tech took the X-ray pictures and the doctor did the actual procedure. It seemed to last about 2 minutes. 

Immediately after it was over the doctor showed me the X-ray and explained what she saw (fortunately my tubes are good, unfortunately my uterus is not the correct shape). I drove myself home and did have some moments of minor discomfort on the way home but no cramping as a lot of people seem to experience. I had a tiny amount of spotting later in the day. I was not given any antibiotics or instructions to abstain from sex. 

I would rate the experience a 3/10 as far as pain goes.

The two week wait is horrible.

It's so confusing to me why everyone around me can have babies but I'm doing everything right and it just feels impossible. I can't stop watching pregnancy YouTube videos and I'm even thinking about it so much it's in my dreams.

Now it’s 16-17. Secondly, I’m spotting a ton during my luteal phase which didn’t used to happen. Like 4-5 days continuously before my period.

I have 2 questions. One is how do you pass the time? We have been talking about having a baby soon but we just recently decided to try and I have been nonstop researching things. Waiting almost an entire month after my period to take a test seems like an eternity right now, so what do you do to help you pass the time?

Also.. Do you take a test every cycle? Is it worth it to do that after the allotted days after potential ovulation? Or do you wait until you see symptoms to take a test? I know this could be different for everyone but I don't want to be spending a bunch of money on tests if there is no use in taking them before seeing potential symptoms.

Last year I jokingly told my husband I wanted a baby as my birthday present since we had just started trying. Oh - how cute I can be. Well, we actually found out a week after my birthday that I was pregnant and all was well. And then we miscarried. But we figured since we were early TTC unicorns we'd take our time to grieve, move forward and all would come together in time. And now we're at the year mark, I've spent the last two weeks with sore boobs, nausea, fatigue and a late period.  Well happy fucking birthday, guess who just showed up. AF. So I'm spending my birthday on my period, trying to focus on work, looking into our insurance (and of course they don't cover anything for infertility, so woohoo), and trying to figure out which OPK is going to be worth getting this next cycle.

Ugh. This is just so not where I thought I'd be.

I am putting together a list of things I can look forward to or enjoy doing if/when my period comes. I have a tendency in the days leading up to it and then the first couple of days once it starts of wasting my time doing nothing in obsessive anticipation and then in misery and I find it hard to get motivated. I think I can utilise that time better because, while some wallowing time is fine just to acknowledge, sitting around moping is not helping me. So far I have:

\- do all the beauty treatments I can't usually do when trying in case the ingredients are harmful (like my The Ordinary AHA/BHA treatment or any other I have lying around that I have put to the side)

\- have baths

\- have Baileys ;)

\- force self to go for a walk each day

\- take a yoga class

\- eat sushi

\- get a massage? (that is more wishful thinking as it's less safe right now - maybe a mani/pedi now)

\- read my French Cosmo magazine (which conveniently this month came right around the dreaded time)

I havent gone for a check up this year but was pregnant 10 months ago and lost her at 22 weeks. Unsure how much periods change after pregnancy but its really driving me crazy how much pms and pregnancy symptoms are similar. I can take the achey boobs but the crampiness just has me worried.

I've been tracking my approximate fertile window with an app and then going off my CM. Fiance and I BD on Sunday and then Monday I noticed EWCM so we BD again in the evening. This morning there was even more EWCM than yesterday so I'm thinking today is my peak day. Do you all think we should try again today (I don't think either of us are really feeling like it again) or does Mondays BD still give us good odds? Is it likely too late to try again tomorrow?

A few days later I started having bleeding and while I am irregular and it could just be a period a week early which is a bit more irregular than my normal irregular everything is just off.

Obviously I know there is nothing that could be done at this point but I’m just really not sure about a lot and the googling I’ve managed to get myself to do hasn’t offered a lot of insight on what may be happening and with this being so incredibly early signs that would mean I need to potentially see a medical professional.

I had bloodwork done to make sure I didn't have any problems causing these long cycles, and thankfully everything came back normal. I know it's possible to get pregnant with long cycles, but my OB mentioned that if I have trouble getting pregnant I can take medication to ovulate sooner.

The doctor prescribed my husband and I a bunch of tests, told me what prenatals to take, etc. I’m feeling a little more hopeful again, maybe I’ll finally get some answers on what’s going on with us. 

Now my only issue is, my parents are overbearing. They need to know every detail about every aspect of my life...and I don’t know how or if I should tell them our issues so they stop with the “when are you giving me grandkids” spiel. We told my mother in law who is always understanding and as soon as we told her, she stopped with the grandkid spiel..but if I tell my parents, I have a feeling my dad is going to like stuff me in the car and take me to the doctors himself and demand answers (it’s not THAT bad, but it is an irrational fear considering how much they smother me sometimes lol) any advice??",t3_ik706d

The next cycle (current one, I think...) on what would have been CD20 I thought I got my period (definitely more than spotting and had cramps) but it only lasted for the day, it was totally gone before I went to bed (my period is usually about 5 days). I have also been using OPKs all cycle and haven’t gotten a positive (currently on CD 24).  I don’t know if that was actually my period or not, so not sure if I should have started tracking a new cycle. I am still taking OPKs, and they are darker than they were around CD10-12 but still only about half as dark as the control line.

Voided and tested OPK anyway and got my first ever positive! A couple of hours later, I tested again, and it was totally negative.

It’s my second month TTC.  Last month I had very clear hormone surges on cycle day 12.  I haven’t had those surges yet (today is cycle day 12) but I did have some very light pink spotting. Nothing crazy, just a little when checking CM.  

I’ve never had ovulation spotting before so I’m unsure if that’s what this is. 
Can you have spotting right before ovulation ? I’m thinking if this is ovulation spotting maybe my hormones will surge tomorrow?

491,TryingForABaby,"A little bit of background, we've been TTC since June and only using OPKs. I decided that I wanted to give temping a shot in addition to the OPKs to verify that ovulation occurred. 

I've heard that before taking your temperature in the morning that you should have at least 3-4 hours of sleep without interruption immediately prior to temping. This is my problem. I will typically wake up throughout the night, sometimes on my own and sometimes from the dog making noise. 

I normally wake up for work at 6:30, but many times I wake up part of the way around 4 or 5 in the morning. Its not consistent night to night, and I dont wake up enough to try to temp at that time. Its barely wake enough to hear what is going on (typically the dog is scratching himself) but I wouldnt be able to try to temp then.

I've only been trying to temp for a couple days now, but each time my temperature is in the 98 degree range. I thought that temps were typically lower, around 96-97 during days prior to ovulation. In case it makes a difference, I have been temping vaginally due to breathing through my mouth while sleeping.

Could this be caused by my partly waking up within that 3-4 hour window? Is there a way to solve this to make my temping more accurate?",t3_ijzh0v

Naturally, I ovulate late (CD19/20) and start my period around CD26. So my luteal phase is very very short. Additionally, nearly every month I start spotting near ovulation and that continues through to my period.

Anyone had abnormal spotting/short luteal phase as your only symptom and gotten some kind of diagnosis? Could it be silent endo? At this point the only thing left to test is an exploratory lap, which my RE is hesitant to do but I’ve had all other basic tests/labs done.

Are there any studies done of male sperm quality impact from these drugs?  I take ADHD Medication, and when I asked my doctor if it would have any impact on our chances of having a healthy baby, he said no, which leads me to believe that it doesn't matter so much so as long as I consume these drugs infrequently.

501,TryingForABaby,"Just kidding - I've just been listening to my doctor's hold music for 30+ minutes now.

So I'm new here, and have pretty much binge read every post relating to late cycles, going off HBC, and late BFN but no AF. I have familiarized myself with the acronyms. I have done the google searches. I have obsessively read article after article about unicorns and miracles and that one chick your friend knows from her sister's ex bf's cousin's aunt's coworker's niece's teacher who randomly showed up at the hospital 9 months pregnant one day and no one ever knew \*rolls eyes\*.

On a more serious note - holy crap. Personally, the moment you realize you're not in the NTNP phase anymore and have somehow solidly moved over into TTC territory is terrifying. I stopped using the Nuvaring in June, took it out at the normal time that month and then never put it back in. We were NTNP in June, and began to transition to TTC in July. This just kinda happened and we're both all for it. I had the normal withdrawal bleed in June the week after I removed it, and then had a normal 30 day cycle in July. Now I'm at the end of August, no AF, and multiple BFNs. I'm driving myself crazy - did I not ovulate? Did I ovulate late? What's going on? I had EWCM at the typical time I ovulate so I assumed I did ovulate (now I'm realizing it's unconfirmed without BBT and I haven't started using OPKs yet). So I'm now calling my doctor to just at least document this and get peace of mind - basically just a professional reassurance that this irregularity is normal when you're coming off HBC and to get it noted in my history if this becomes a pattern.

It's frustrating - I used Nuvaring for 10+ years. During that decade, I was diagnosed with a digestive disorder that affects my weight and ability to digest food. So I don't know how that affects my cycle as an adult, since I got super lucky as a teenager and was fairly regular before starting HBC. Anyways. It's nice to find a community like this. I've been driving my husband crazy with not knowing, and I know how ridiculous I'm being right now lol. I definitely got ahead of myself and had false confidence that August's cycle would be normal since July wasn't seemingly affected. I'm also at the point where I'm actively trying to jinx AF into coming so I can start another cycle and try again. I've taken the expensive pregnancy tests before the cheapies, I've worn my 'nice' house pants (still quarantining/WFH here), I'm still optimistic I may be pregnant (I know there's like no chance of this lolol), and I'm now finally calling my doctor. Where are you AF!??

Thanks for reading ya'll. I hope you're having a great morning so far and am sending good vibes your way :)

\*\*EDITED WITH DR UPDATES\*\* I'm normal. Totally, 100% normal. It can take up to 3 months for your cycle to regulate when stopping HBC (as I've read a million times in the past week or so, duh self). I am to call back if I don't get a period within 3 months of my last one or if I get a positive pregnancy test, whichever comes first (if at all). I basically was telling myself this, but it's nice to hear it all straight from my doctor. Thanks anxiety!",t3_ijzvi4

515,TryingForABaby,"Long post disclosure...

My husband and I decided recently to TTC for the first time. I bought the CB advanced digital OT with 20 tests, but figured we would just take this first cycle of trying with a “laid back” approach, especially because I have never had any irregular cycles, medical issues, etc. 

My last period started on the 8th, it was about 4-5 days as usual, and we started trying every day to every other day up until CD18. We took a break for 2-3 days because we were exhausted lol and I took an OT twice in that time, which both implied low fertility - great! 

Everything I have read suggests that women with normal 28 day cycles will ovulate around day 12-16. I tracked my CM as well throughout my cycle and it seemed like I was ovulating around that time period based on my observations. 

Yesterday, CD22, I was feeling off and my CM changed a bit. I took an OT expecting low/no fertility because of it being the last week of my cycle...it showed up as fertile! Not yet ovulating, but the surge was there implying it would be a good time to TTC. I took one again today, CD23, still fertile. I also read that it could be detecting the pregnancy hormone, so I took an early detection CB PT, not pregnant :( really wish I wouldn’t have taken it......

Now I’m worried...why would I be getting a positive OT this late in my cycle?! I started looking into it and have gotten a lot of scary results...I guess my questions are:

Is it possible to ovulate late in a “normal” 28 day cycle and not have anything “wrong” with you?

Can we still conceive this late into my cycle?

Should I check with my OBGYN sooner rather than later even though we just started trying?

Am I freaking out over nothing?

Yes, I have a lazy sunday ahead of me. Like I have a lazy saturday behind me. Another day I spend idling around, doing nothing useful and go to bed early, because I just want these empty days to end. 

Yes, we can be spontaneous. Yet, we don't travel, because we save our money for the house we bought for our future kids. And for the clinic that we will likely need to get pregnant.

Yes, we are free and not tied down. But we don't go out. We don't party. We don't treat ourselves with expensive stuff. Because we save all our money for TTC and what may come after that.

Since we realized that our TTC leads nowhere, our lives has become empty and grey. We don't enjoy the things we used to enjoy anymore. It just feels like it's all pointless. It's all just a big blurry mess of sadness and despair, endless tests and appointments, anxiety and hopelessness.

It’s not that I’m against medication, but I have my own personal reasons on why I would prefer not to. In any event, I just finished my last dose last night and I’ve already noticed two things that are completely abnormal for me. The first is that I am still spotting and I’m on CD 8. The second thing is my LH levels are extremely low (I’ve never seen them so low since staring OPKs 8 months ago). My menstrual cycles are always every 26 days and last for 5 days. My ovulation cycles are always between 12-13 days. My husband is telling me not to panic and justifies the changes based on my body adjusting to the hormonal treatment.

On one hand I want to get another test to be certain, but on the other hand I feel like I’m just trying to break my own heart. Idk someone just tell me what to do!",t3_ijp6da
524,TryingForABaby,"So, this is my first ever post!

But I was wondering if anyone had any advice on ovulation strips. Me and husband, 24 are about to begin TTC and have some cheap Amazon ovulation tests but I was wondering if you’d all advise these? Or do you think a more reputable brand would be more accurate? 

Idk if it’s a silly question but I don’t want cheap tests to delay our conception!",t3_ijp0aw

526,TryingForABaby,"Has anyone read “the nourishing traditions book of baby and child care”? 

She focuses a lot on whole nutrition and specifics such as cod liver oil, beef liver and other high nutrient animal fats and incorporating these into the diet for up to 2 years before TTC. She’s associated with the Weston A Price Foundation which focuses on this approach of whole nutrition also. 

I’m into her books and this one particularly to prep my body before TTC. Wondering if anyone else uses her books or advice.",t3_ijpzdk
527,TryingForABaby,"Hi all. My husband (28) and I (25) are on our first cycle of TTC. I have been diligently using easy@home OPKs and I ovulated yesterday. We had intercourse every day for the 3 days leading up to O, the day of, and again today (my husband says his peen feels like it’s going to fall off now, lol). I have been only feeling excited up until day, realizing I am officially 1 DPO and thinking about having to wait to take a test just hit me with a MASSIVE anxiety attack and felt like I couldn’t breathe. I’ve been able to talk myself down but I’m worried about being able to sleep tonight and this whole week. And then that leads me to think that if I get a negative test, it will be solely because I was so anxious, which is giving me MORE anxiety thinking I could screw it all up for us, and that I will just spiral out of control. To make matters worse, we have a long weekend ahead. Monday will be Labor Day and I will be 9 DPO. I really don’t want to take a test until at least 10 DPO, but I feel like I am going to be in agony all weekend over it. Can someone please tell me this is normal? Is it still possible to get pregnant in a normal amount of time when you are dealing with anxiety? Any tips to relieve it or at least not put the blame on myself? I’m feeling so overwhelmed that I’m questioning if this will ever be able to happen for us, if we have to keep dealing with me feeling this way every cycle. Thanks in advance..",t3_ijl01y
528,TryingForABaby,"Edit: Thank you guys, you have really calmed my nerves! I was putting off trying meds for so long. I'm really hoping trying Lexapro will help me and I'm so relieved to read that it sounds like a pretty safe drug for pregnant women. Thank you again :) 

Hi, I have suffered from generalised anxiety for years. I have been able to copy quite well without medication up until pretty recently. 

Unfortunately I have now started suffering from physical symptoms of anxiety (feeling like I am going to fall over while walking around, tingly feelings in my hands sometimes, weird things like that. I definitely don't have anything physically wrong with me so I know it's anxiety-related. 

My therapist just suggested that I try a low dose of Lexapro as he thinks it will really help me manage the physical symptoms. I mentioned that my partner and I are planning to have a baby soon and he said if I conceive it's no big deal, I stop the drugs.

However now I'm wondering if I should stop TTC for a couple cycles? It makes me upset to consider that as we were supposed to start TTC in February then had to stop because of Coronavirus, then we planned to start again in June and had to stop because of family drama. Now we really feel like it's the right time and I feel like we should stop again because of Lexapro. :(

What do you guys think? Who knows, it might take me 6 months to conceive. Or this might be the month. I don't know what to do...

I really don't want to stop TTC but what if I get my BFP this month (wishful thinking...) and then there was no point to trying Lexapro as I'd have to stop it pretty much immediately.

Idk I'm mostly venting lol. Any advice ladies?

If it's helpful at all here is my TTC info: 25F, I'm currently on CD 12 and expect to ovulate CD14. Currently on cycle 2 of TTC but I did try for almost two cycles in February and March which were obviously unsuccessful.

Sorry, this post is all over the place!",t3_ijp5wk
529,TryingForABaby,"My husband had testicular cancer about 20 years ago. He was 18. He Lost one testicle and had two rounds of chemo. We have a great sex life with no problems at all, but since we started TTC I have been wondering how his cancer and chemo might have affected his sperm. He has pretty much repressed all memories of this time, and we dont really want to ask his parents if they know about any post therapy tests that were done because we dont want them to know we are TFAB.
It is a very touchy subject for him and he doesnt want to get tested until at least six months in.",t3_ijk7ac
530,TryingForABaby,"So I am either 18DPO or CD6 depending on what’s going on. But I had spotting 2 days before my predicted period 11DPO and the day of my period I started a lighter than usual bleed and the following days were alternating between red and brown blood and it was on and off.  But I don’t have any positive tests.

Anyway fast forward to today 18DPO I had a BM later in the day (4pm) and when I looked I saw what I believed to be watery/ewcm hanging from my lady area haha. Me and my husband had BD earlier in the day at like 930am, but this discharge didn’t seem or feel like semen. My OPKs today have been low/negative so I’m wondering if I’m going to be ovulating earlier. And if this weird period had something to do with this change. I also checked my cervix today before sex and it was high/firm/and closed so my signals are all over the place. I did recently (mid June) have an ovary removal, and a regular seeming period 3.5/4 weeks after that. 

What do you all think? I’m fascinated by all these clues my body is giving me, but I wish it would just tell me what’s going on 😂",t3_ijrnvk

534,TryingForABaby,"Hi all, im on C3, and this is my first month temping and using opk's. Currently on CD14 of a typically 27/28 day cycle.

According to FF my temps are saying today is so far my most fertile day.

Ovulation tests have all come back negative so far inc today - day 7 of use (using the clear blue digital and had all circles) 

Started EWCM yesterday, and having some cramping which I usually associate with ovulation.

We've been doing the deed every few days for about a week (just incase) as it's the tail end of FW according to FF, Flo and Clue, but I believe I ovulate about 2/3 days after Flo and Clue predict. That would be today/tomorrow.

Should I be getting a positive on the opk now? Should I test again tonight or just wait til tomorrow? I only have 3 left so I dont want to miss it haha. 
I had a anomaly month length last month so trying to use them to figure out my luteal phase length to help timing. 

Any advice would be great because this ish is confusing!",t3_ijqsnm

536,TryingForABaby,"Hi all! My husband and I are one month into TTC and I have been thinking about medication. I haven’t seen a doctor yet and discontinued my birth control on my own in July, but I take 10 mg of Lexapro daily for my anxiety. Would I need to stop the meds while trying to conceive or once I become pregnant? Has anyone else on the same medication asked their doctor these questions already?

539,TryingForABaby,So I’ve known for a while that I’m anemic but I had no idea that it could effect fertility and even cause anovulation. In other words I don’t ovulate but still have a period.

We have [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/wiki/rules) we expect all community members will follow. Posts and comments that do not follow these rules will be removed by the mod team. If you see something that is breaking one of these rules, please use the report button or [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTryingForABaby). The major community-specific rules are detailed below.

* **No BFPs (big fat positives; i.e., positive pregnancy results) or other comments about ongoing pregnancies outside the weekly thread.** TFAB is for talking about trying to get pregnant, and when you get a positive test, you've graduated! We love when community members get pregnant, and we ask that you post your about your positive test in the weekly stickied BFP thread only. In threads/comments other than the weekly thread, do not mention your ongoing pregnancy and do not link to your posts about it in other subs. This rule extends to both posts and comments, and includes any positive result, even if it's faint, and any ongoing pregnancy.

* **No posts asking other users to tell their success stories.** If you want to create a post asking specifically for success stories (*e.g.*, ""Has anyone else experienced this weird thing and then gotten a BFP?"" ""How long did it take you to conceive after this situation?""), please do so over on a pregnancy sub. These posts are soliciting stories that break the ""no positive pregnancy tests outside the weekly thread"" rule above. This includes asking for a follow up from a user who is planning to test soon. 

* **No ""am I pregnant?"" posts.** Do not ask the community if you're pregnant, either in direct or roundabout ways. No one, including your doctor, can tell you whether you're pregnant or not based off symptoms and/or charts -- no single symptom or group of symptoms is a guarantee that you are pregnant. If you think you're pregnant, you need to take a pregnancy test. If you just want to get it out, though, /r/amipregnant is a great place to ask these questions.

* **Don't ""bingo"" other users.** Don't suggest unhelpful cliches to others that belong on a TTC bingo card: ""just relax"", ""never give up, mama!"", ""why not adopt?"", ""my cousin's dogsitter's sister was about to do IVF but then got magically pregnant,"" etc. These are ""bingos"" because people who are TTC hear them all the time, and they are more hurtful than helpful. For further explanation, check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/d878k2/new_rule_no_bingos_examples_and_explanations/)!

* **Please be kind and think about the words you use.** Trying to conceive is an emotional topic and we want to respect others' opinions and views, even if they may be different than yours. There's no one right way to go about TTC, and we have users here at all stages of the process and with all family configurations. This is a safe and supportive community for all people TTC.

546,TryingForABaby,I don’t know if this is the right place but i am going through so much with my SO (22f) (28m) while trying to conceive. We both planned this pregnancy together and now every little argument he tells me to get rid of the baby we lost our first child together in June due to a miscarriage. I want him to be more caring it hurts when I have to literally cry myself to bed every night he works so much we almost missed the fertile window while trying to conceive I am not even sure if I hit the right days I feel like I am the only one who wants this to happen now.. would I be selfish to keep the baby? He want to leave me alone because I asked him if he could talk to me about why he chooses to break up instead of communicating and finding solutions.. he was fine we were getting along fine until the beginning of the month. We live together Friday he stayed out and didn’t even bother to call and check on me today makes 4dpo and I am cramping I think I am pregnant. I am not so happy like I was at first,t3_ijpx0z

My partner and I are still in the WTT phase but I'd like to know this for when that time does come for us. How did you start out? Did you have sex every other day? Did you only have sex during the days leading up to ovulation? Did you track straight away using OPKs?

552,TryingForABaby,"Perhaps this is the wrong place for this, but I couldn’t think of a better group of people than those also TTC. 

I am planning to conceive with a good friend of mine, whom I have known for 4 years. He and I dated briefly and ended things mutually. We have always joked about having a baby together, but we finally started get serious and talking about it. I’m 30 and he is 35. Right now we are in the planning stages, and having discussions around parenting styles, cost/money, logistics of sharing a baby, etc. 

I am not particularly close to my family, partially because they are very religious and I am not. Most people are excited to tell family and friends about a pregnancy, but I’m not sure how to handle explaining my situation to a possibly disapproving crowd. I’m mainly concerned with my family, as I think they will feel comfortable asking questions like “who is the father?” I also think they will no hold back on voicing their opinions on if this is an appropriate relationship to raise a child in. On a secondary level, I’m not sure how to handle awkward questions from coworkers, where I’m really not interested in going into details about who my baby’s father is. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Or advice on some straight-forward ways to combat the awkward or offensive line of questioning about a single woman having a baby? It’s much appreciated!",t3_ij725a

Update: AF showed up on CD30. I’m blaming the vitamin B6 that I’ve started taking, which encourages progesterone production. I’m not going to complain about the longer luteal phase, though! Keeping my fingers crossed that September is our month!",t3_ij6s2b
561,TryingForABaby,"Feeling really down and worried today. I got off the pill in June after being on it for almost 12 years. Before the pill, I think my cycle was normal and I don't remember my period being too difficult but I wasn't tracking or anything. 

Anyway, after getting off the pill it took 38 days to get my period back and this cycle I just hit day 35 with no period in sight and tests are negative. I did do OPKs but didn't feel like I got a clear positive.

I know, I KNOW it is early. I KNOW it can take 3 cycles to regulate. I KNOW. 

But the thought of months or years of trying ahead of me without knowing whether or not I can get pregnant feels really daunting. I was always anxious it would be hard for me to get pregnant and the long cycles without a clear positive OPK feels like the beginning of my anxieties being confirmed. 

If a doctor told me today that I couldn't get pregnant, I could handle it and move towards accepting it but the uncertainty is driving me insane.

I realize this post might be really annoying to people with actual medical issues and who have been trying for a long time.

Just for a background on me, I’m 35.  We conceived our daughter (who is 6) literally on our first month trying so this is all new to me.  I was diagnosed with PCOS about 3 years ago after my periods never regulated after 15 months BFing.  I was put on Metformin, I lost some weight, and my periods have been like clockwork ever since.  I have some of the hormonal symptoms of PCOS (the annoying hair growth, weight etc) but my period cramps aren’t too bad, and my period usually has 3 heavy/medium days and 1-2 light days.

I’ve been using the CBDA OPKs for three months, along with the cheapie WONDFOs just for comparison.  I have a clear fertile weak with a peak around CD 14-15., along with the cramping that usually comes with ovulation.  We usually BD CD 13-15 (I wish we had the energy to BD every day of the fertile week but 30s + kiddo + jobs means sometimes we’re just too tired lol).

I saw my OB three months ago for my annual and she said as long as I’m regular and confident that I’m ovulating every month she’s not concerned, but told me if *Im* concerned she’s here to help me, but I dont know if I need to ask for testing or something, or if I can do more at home.

I guess this is just a long post asking for help.  I want my daughter to have a sibling before she’s too old to have a relationship with them.  I already feel like I’m running out of time.  None of my friends or family have ever really struggled with this so I feel kind of on my own.

571,TryingForABaby,"Hi All, 

In May I got pregnant, and had a confusing bleeding episode (week or so of more than spotting, more like a period) before the pregnancy was confirmed. I went into get HCG levels checked and an US, and HCG never doubled. The first US measured at \~5 weeks, and I had to wait two stressful weeks to have another US and measure growth or confirm loss. At 8 weeks, the 2nd US confirmed a loss, likely around the time of the previous appt, and I had a D&amp;C soon after. 

I got my next period about 4 weeks after the D&amp;C and TTC for the cycle. However, about a week after ovulation (I have a \~28 day cycle), I bled again, kind of like the most recent pregnancy. It lasted about 4-5 days, was never ""heavy"", but way more than spotting. I emailed my Dr and she said to wait, take a test and see if you are pregnant when you would expect to (ie - day 28+). I took a test today - not pregnant according to those tests (though my breasts are sore, etc). I also am not getting a period when I would expect it (today!).   
Was that week-early bleeding my period? How should I attempt to know when ovulation is occuring for the next cycle? I just bought OPK strips, so I guess that is the best way forward, but interested in feedback.",t3_ij32sb

573,TryingForABaby,"If we don't get pregnant this month, I think I'm going to take a break. I never knew trying was so hard. That must sound so dumb to many of you. But my husband and I have fallen pregnant twice, both times with literally no effort (other than the obvious). 

This time we're 3mo in with no baby in sight, and I'm starting to comprehend that emotional roller coaster I've heard so much about. Ouch. 

Add to it, and this is the real vent, my husband and I, who are usually in near perfect harmony, had our worst ever fight today. It was about a lot of things, but the part that drew proverbial blood was his parenting. He thinks I think he's a shit dad. I don't, but I definitely think he expects totally unreasonable things from our nearly 2yo son, and it's causing unnecessary and damaging battles. 

Hubby then dropped a bomb on me - he said he doesn't enjoy parenting. He loves our son, wouldn't change having him, likes hanging out with him, but doesn't overall like parenting. 

I nearly died when he said that. He wanted kids, not me. OK, kid. I'm the one who's wanted to go for number 2. And after today, I really think I might just let it rest a couple months, wait for life to maybe be less shit. 

Because of course there's covid, the inexorable boa constrictor. And where I live there was just a devastating storm, followed by more damaging winds. We've come through unscathed but within blocks there are people entering their 4th day with no power and no water. 

And my state is in HARD lockdown. No school, childcare, going to work, going more than 5km. Now with the wind damage, I'm afraid to go outside because we're in a forest so the trees will drop weakened branches for days yet. Someone was crushed by a tree at my local supermarket 3 days ago. One of my mates in a volunteer fire-fighter and was with thr poor bloke as he died. I don't have the emotional resilience to handle that. 

And to top it all off, we had truly awful, terrifying, heart wrenching bushfire 6mo ago, and the latest storms have reminded me of what it feels like to be afraid of nature. The next state over has just reported its first fire for the season, even though it's still winter. How there's anything left to burn, I don't know. 

I'm tired, scared, hurt, angry, but most of all I'm just so so sad. Sad that my happiness at wanting another baby is dissolving into heartache, sad that my wonderful husband isn't loving being a dad as much as I love being a mum, sad that my goddamn country is burning, drowning or blowing away, sad that we can't see family, sad that when I finally get to see someone other than my husband I won't be able to get a hug... 

Thanks for listening. I just needed to talk, and I don't want to tell any of this to anyone who knows us. I'd hate any of our friends to think less of my husband as a father because he doesn't deserve that, and so many people have it SO MUCH worse - hell I'm nearly the only one in my mum's group who hasn't lost power this week, who isn't struggling for money or with working from home, whose kid sleeps... 

I just want a big sleep and a nice day at a park. I can't have either, but I will again. Someday. Maybe there'll be 1 kid with me, maybe 2. I hope it's 2, and I hope my beautiful husband is there smiling next to me in the sun.",t3_ij8ij4

578,TryingForABaby,"This is my first cycle TTC so please forgive how little I know about all this.

I posted a question about ferning two days ago and got a few people asking me what the heck ferning is and to update on how it was working. 

Honestly I still don’t know but I have more data to show now. I never saw ferns at all before CD10.


https://imgur.com/gallery/ZfXFwti

I saw what I think is transitional ferning on CD 10 (my last cycle was 25 days but it can be between 25-30) 

On CD 11, I think I got to “full ferning”, or at least as close to it as I had ever seen so far. 

This morning I see no ferns at all. I was up until like 2AM though just hanging out with my husband. Not sure if that effects it. 🤷‍♀️ 

I also have my OKPs and temping chart in the link so you can compare them with my ferning days. 

I’m 32 with hashimoto’s (treated and under control) and possibly PCOS. I say possibly, because people with hashimoto’s are more likely to have PCOS, and I’ve had ovarian cysts since I was 13, but no doctor has ever told me “you have PCOS.” My periods are vaguely regular when my thyroid is regulated (which it is) and I don’t have excess body hair. I do struggle with my weight, but that could also be attributed to just hashimoto’s. I’m also only about 12 lbs overweight, which, I get the impression is pretty good for someone with PCOS AND hashimoto’s, so maybe I don’t have PCOS? ( I have an OBGYN appointment next month.)

I say all that to explain why I am tracking EVERYTHING so hard, right out of the gate in cycle 1. I expect to have a very hard time getting pregnant. 

Anyway, I’m worried that maybe I don’t ovulate. If anyone has any insight that my ferning/OPKs/temp chart look “normal so far” that would be great, though I totally understand if you can’t tell yet.

From what I understand, my ferning tests indicate I should be ovulating today or have just finished, but my OPKs show no positive results. I have no clue how to read the temp chart. 

Thanks in advance for any advice or insight at all! ❤️

First of all, the nurse was great and talked everything over, that was fine. But then I got into position and then they realized the computer wasn't working. So then my legs started burning while they tried to restart the computer.

Eventually they get it going, and it's uncomfortable and a little painful. Then it got worse. Then I hear the doctor say he's going to try and inflate the balloon more, and I heard a 'pop'. So they try a second balloon. Still not in the right position. So they make me lift my hips way up (which is very difficult while everything's painful) to put me on something to tilt up my hips. And finally the third time they're able to get the balloon in, but at this point I am crying in pain. It was awful. Then they remove the thing I was balancing on, and my legs start to shake while they finally actually take the pictures. 

Afterwards, the doctor showed me the image and what was supposed to be a straight tube looked more like an L. One ovary seemed basically in the right spot, while the other was jammed halfway up my abdomen. I know I've had an OB tell me I had a ""deep"" uterus before, and when I got a transvaginal ultrasound they couldn't find the one ovary, but that was the first time I've seen exactly what that meant.

I had a feeling yesterday it was coming because I was crazy bitchy and plain rude (lmao) so my husband and his friend both knew it was coming, lmao. I think I knew too but didn’t want to believe it, so I was extra bitchy. 

My doctor told me I could do another IUI or move to IVF, but that he didn’t want me to do more than 2 IUI. From what I’ve seen with women with the same condition as me, the overwhelming majority did up to IUI and moved to IVF anyways. Only a few had successful IUI and that was after multiple tries. 

My lovely husband left the decision up to me, but told me not to stress about the cost. We’ve been saving for this since we knew it was a real possibility so we’re prepared, but it would just be so nice to have that money for when baby is here! Oh well.. 

I’ve made the decision to move forward with IVF. I’m sad that the IUI didn’t work, and that I have to move onto this measure. However, I’m excited and hopeful that we’re one step closer to our little one. I’m hoping it goes well and I can get a good amount of fertilized/healthy embryos.

597,TryingForABaby,"Hi everyone! I’m trying to better understand the Clearblue opks. My wife is on letrozole for PCOS. The ultrasound today at CD14 showed very mature follicle and she anticipated ovulation today or within the next two days. She had us do the Clearblue test tonight and she fully expected it to have the flashing or static smiley face and gave us a sex schedule accordingly. But of course it was just a circle. 

We have used this test before but recently got a new reader. My understanding was that the reader can take time to adjust to personal hormone levels. Is that accurate? And can you interpret the strip that you put into the reader?",t3_iihrie

I been checking the LH everyday,  and it is low. Just one of the day it was slightly darker but not dark. Now it is much lighter. The one that changed color was on 08/26. So did that mean my ovulation is 08/26 not 09/01?

Now that the time is here I am questioning everything. Are we ready? Will we sleep again? Do we have enough saved? Can we raise a good human being? Did I read enough books? Will we get pregnant first few months? Why are there a million 'must haves' for something less than 10 pounds? And mostly, will my parents just be worried or will they be happy for us?

604,TryingForABaby,"Hi all! I've been lurking for some time while waiting to find out why my periods are irregular and I haven't been able to conceive in almost a year. 

I didn't know what to expect but finding out my husband has a slightly low sperm count and my irregular periods are due to an unexplained hormone imbalance, was not it. Even though my periods are all over the place and LH:FSH ratio is 2:1, my fertility doctor didn't diagnose me with PCOS. He suggested I take provera to kick start a period and then do IUI.

I'm wondering why he didn't suggest regulating my cycles through medication and went straight to IUI instead? Would it be a waste of time if I wanted to medically regulate my cycle and time sex better before going for IUI, considering my DH's lower than average sperm count? I want to know all my options before shelling out the money for something that may happen by itself, eventually, with a little less help.

I have an appointment booked with my fertility doctor next week, just wanted insight from others who may be in a similar situation. I never thought I would be in this position, and I can't even get a hug from a friend because of COVID-19 ☹️",t3_iihv7v
605,TryingForABaby,"So this stings - I’m on cycle 17 of TTC and just found out this morning that one of my close friends is pregnant and was one of the lucky ones to conceive during her first month trying. She’s known that I’ve been TTC since April 2019, and that I’ve read and researched the process left and right and up and down, and when she was ready to start her journey in June 2020 she asked me what she should do if she wanted to take TTC seriously. Whelp folks, I successfully coached a friend into a unicorn round and all I’ve done is cry on and off all day since she told me. 

I had a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy earlier this week and she knew the surgery was coming up but she didn’t reach out to check in, which fine, I get that supporting friends in infertility is uncomfortable and I don’t want to demand support from people, but finding out her news today after catching on to a suspect statement and finally mustering up the courage to ask her if she was pregnant via text just broke me a little. And to add insult to injury, she said she had wanted to tell me in person when she saw me next weekend but felt awkward avoiding the question when I asked in a text like it didn’t even cross her mind that her getting pregnant so easily might be hard news for me to hear. 

So I did what any good friend would do and I told her that I’m so, so excited for her, but that was a lie. I am not excited. I am sad. And I really wish I wasn’t. And I really wish I didn’t have to lie.",t3_ii0u9z

607,TryingForABaby,"I just feel depressed nowadays.

I began TTC without knowing how hard it would be. I stopped wine and coffee 3 months before we started TTC - told everyone about it (so they understand why we are not drinking). I feel ashamed that I am not pregnant yet. I feel weird telling people I'm not pregnant yet (no one asks but everyone knows we have been trying so I feel like I need to let them know). 

I am tired of peeing for OPK especially now that I found out that I might have PCOS and the OPK result might not even be correct. I am tired that I am not getting used to sleeping with an arm band to check BBT. 

I am tired of telling my husband that we need to have sex. He is supportive and always initiate sex with me whenever I tell him to but it's just not the same anymore. 

I can't seem to find joy in life anymore. Everything seems to be covered with gray color.... like all the good and colorful thing is covered with gray so I don't feel that happy or grateful anymore. There are sparks of moments when I smile but I generally feel down. 

I've been telling my husband about how I'm thinking about drinking wine on my first say of period. So far, I haven't. I understand and don't judge anyone who decides to drink until confirmed pregnancy. It's just something I planned not to do before I started this TTC journey so I think I might feel like a horrible person if I do end up drinking (and that it won't be enjoyable). 

My husband's close friend is visiting us next weekend so now my husband wants to drink when his friend is here. He even suggests maybe I can drink too and maybe that will loose me up. I feel so upset that my husband is suggesting of drinking during TWW. I know he doesn't have bad intentions but still...

I just feel depressed. I don't feel confident that I can be a good mom anymore given that I can be so depressed for a little thing (not getting pregnant quickly) when there can be so many worse thing in life. Like, am I emotionally stable enough to care for another person regardless of what life brings us? 

A part of me is still hopeful and thinks I will be okay once I do get pregnant. So a part of me just wants to step all the steps and do IUI so at least I don't have to pee for OPK or have scheduled sex anymore. 

I want to take a week or so from work but we are saving PTO so we can visit family for Thanksgiving. I don't think I will be able to take a week off using sick days just because I'm feeling depressed.

Perhaps this is all be because of a carb/sugar withdrawal... I also just started minimizing carb/sugar intake after finding out I might have PCOS. 

Not sure how to pick myself up and be happy again. I can feel that my husband is getting tired of being overly cheerful and optimistic for me while I just stay in bed crying and depressed.",t3_ii7ios
608,TryingForABaby,"Hello!  I'm relatively new here, but love how supportive this community is &lt;3

My BF already has 4 kiddos from a previous marriage so I'm pretty sure everything is good on his end.

I had a preconception appointment and everything looks good healthy wise, I've also been tracking my cycles for the last 3 years and was only on BC for 2 years prior(the pill and nuvaring). I have a pretty regular cycle, 29-31 days and typically ovulate between CD 14-16 based on temping and CM but of course this month when I'm TTC I'm on CD21 and still haven't ovulated yet. All of my OPK's have been negative, I did get some watery CM yesterday but it seems to be creamy today, my Temps are still relatively low between 96.3 and 96.7. 

I was on Spironolactone from 3/2019 - 11/2019 and then off from 11/2019 - 3/2020 and then went back on it 3/2020 till 8/1/2020 when I decided we were gonna start trying. I was on 125mg a day and it did give me a period every 2 weeks but every time I've stopped my periods would just go back to normal so I though maybe it just threw me off this month but I would've had my second ""period"" a week ago if that were the case...
 
I will link my most recent OPK's, I started on CD10 but wasn't able to get it all in the shot and they were definitly negative barley a line at all. Just wondering if I might not ovulate at all or if it's still possible for me to this late? Any advice would be much appreciated!

Brief intro: My husband and I have tried to conceive for 5 years (with some breaks for sanity sake) and I’ve never been pregnant. We had extensive testing done and there is no identifiable reason for us to not be getting pregnant. 

We are currently back on the trying train. 

I’m wondering if it’s normal to have a peak ovulation result for 7 days in a row..? I purchased the clear blue digital ovulation test (comes with 10 strips) and for 7 straight days it gives me the smiley face that indicates peak ovulation. Because it’s digital I’m not analyzing the lines myself which could lead to misinterpreting the result.

617,TryingForABaby,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently on cycle 2 of TTC.  I'm still trying to figure out my cycle and when everything happens since I was on the pill for so long and only been off it for 2 months.

I took a test a week ago (before my app-predicted fertile window) just as a precaution, because I had a tattoo appointment so wanted to be sure before going through with it (appt was postponed anyway for other reasons), and the test was negative.

That being said, I just finished my fertile window (if my app is accurate) and my period is due in about 2 weeks.  Like many of you I'm sure, I'm itching to test again, but don't know how early is too early, and if I should just not think about it and wait for possible symptoms!

Anyway, I'm just curious at what point other people decide to take a test.  Do you wait until your missed period/other symptoms, or do you test early before your period? Do you find you have more/less anxiety depending which way you go?",t3_ii7ezi
618,TryingForABaby,"TTC 9 months, finally got sent for scans and a tubal patency test yesterday (tubal patency hurt like FUCK btw, even when you're full of valium). 
Anyway, tubes were clear YAY! but as the radiologist gynaecologist was guiding the catheter in, she found a growth of some sort in my uterus. 
I got asked 100 questions, none of which helped her figure out what it is. But she thinks it's probably why I'm not pregnant. It's taking up a fair bit of real estate in there so there's much less room for implantation to occur. 
She said my doctor will probably organise a biopsy. 

All I know is it's about the size of a pea,
It doesn't have blood flow according to ultrasound.. 
It's not in the lining, it's embedded into the actual uterus itself and dangles like a uvula into the uterine cavity.
And I don't know what it is. 

I dont have an appointment with my fertility specialist about the results until the 9th September, so I've got a week and a half to think about this thing. 

My husband is being supportive and telling me not to worry, it's nothing to worry about until somebody tells us it is. 
But i can't help thinking that it's some kind of cancer, or that it's going to make me permanently infertile.
I'm probably being to negative and over thinking things but I'm SO FUCKING SCARED. 
Every time my mind pauses and I'm not distracted, I'm on the verge of tears because I'm thinking about whatever this thing is. 

I want it gone.

Not to mention I have PCOS, so my cycles are so unpredictable and I occasionally just skip a month all together. Two of the friends have been complaining that it’s been so hard because they didn’t get pregnant the first cycle.

This morning, I got a text from one of my friends that she is now pregnant. Later in the afternoon I got a text from the other one that she is also pregnant. This friend has a baby that isn’t even one yet and also got pregnant with her first on her first try. I want to be so happy for them but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hurt and I didn’t shed a few tears of frustration/jealousy with my own situation. It was really just a double whammy and I’ve been in a funk all day. It seems like everyone around me gets pregnant SO fast. If I even had just one friend I knew that it took a little longer maybe I’d feel a little more normal. It’s so hard to watch people get pregnant so fast one right after the other. Especially when I’ve been trying to hard with tracking ovulation and feeling like we are doing everything right with no such luck.

636,TryingForABaby,"I'll try and summarise this as best I can; Husband and I have been trying since July of last year. After some issues regulating after my Nexplanon removal, I got a PCOS diagnosis in February. I've done 4 cycles of Letrozole now and am about to start my 5th.

My OBGYN agreed last time I saw her (2 months ago), that if we hadn't had any success by September 1st, we'd move onto IUI and she'd refer me over to the right person for it. I assumed that'd be an RE.

Today I had a telemed appointment with her and we spoke over video call. The plan was to still go through with an IUI, but as she put it ""she thinks she can still manage me"" so she, or one of the other obgyns on call, will do the IUI. That wasn't what I was expecting to hear, as I went into it thinking I'd finally get a referral to see an RE. She instead instructed me to do Letrozole CD 3-7 again and then just call as soon as I get a peak OPK so we can go in, do the sample and sperm wash, and then insemination a few hours later. And then bam that's that, IUI done. Thanks to a scheduling mess up, my call with her was cut really short so I only got to ask what the plan moving forward was (at that point I had so many questions I wanted to ask but only managed to squeeze this one in as she was trying to end the call). Her answer was that we'd increase the Letrozole dosage and try a few more times.

I have not had a monitored cycle on Letrozole, and I know that's not uncommon especially due to COVID, but I don't like that I won't even be monitored for the IUI. The only testing I've had done is the testing for the PCOS diagnosis (bloodwork and the transvaginal US), and then CD21 bloodwork to confirm O with the Letrozole, which was 2 months ago. I guess based off so many other experiences I read from others, I was expecting the process for the IUI to be different, and to be monitored to make sure we weren't just taking a shot in the dark.

I felt so frustrated and lost, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and just find an RE on my own. After a few hours of calling around I managed to get a telemed appointment with an RE so I could have a second opinion on what I should be doing (who happens to specialise in PCOS, as recommended by the front desk staff I spoke to) at a fertility clinic (not related to the practice my OBGYN is in at all). My issue is that the soonest appointment they could get me is September 17th. CD1 should be any day now, so I'd O before the RE consult, meaning that the IUI would be about a week before the consult.

So now my question is.. should I go through with the IUI via my OBGYN? or should I hold off until after I get to do the consult with the RE? I don't like the idea of just flushing time and money down the drain by doing the IUI without making sure that the Letrozole dosage is doing everything it needs to be, or that my tubes are fine, as I haven't done an HSG. My OBGYN noted we could do one in a few months if the IUI's weren't successful. I don't understand why we should have to wait even longer to do that, considering this upcoming month is month 14 of trying.

I just want some advice/opinions on what people think I should do. I don't want to be wasting the RE's time by going ahead with an IUI with the OBGYN, I don't want to miss out on a chance to get a BFP by not doing it, I also don't want to do anything without getting an opinion directly from the RE. I'm just so confused.",t3_ihtpt8
637,TryingForABaby,"I had a miscarriage in May. Prior to this, the 7-10 days leading up to my period, my boobs would always be super sore each cycle. Like, walking too fast would hurt them.

Any ideas as to why it might be?",t3_ihyimp
638,TryingForABaby,"We are trying to conceive and I think my period is late. It's hard to tell because it wasn't that long ago that I came off the pill and 2 months ago my cycle was 28 days and last month was 29. But this month, I am now on day 31. I have been feeling pretty miserable the last few weeks as I had a few arguments with my husband and we didn't have sex a lot and so I felt this month was a loss. Plus I was getting all the PMS symptoms - so not a good few weeks. But...it's day 31. I'm trying hard not to read into because I was so excited last month so I didn't want to get my hopes up.

HOWEVER, I think I want to try taking a test tomorrow morning and I haven't told my partner. Poor guy, he thought when I said I had PMS the other week that it already meant I had my period. I think he just assumes I have it because I've been cranky!

When we initially decided to try, I thought I wouldn't say too much so I could surprise him in some fun creative way. Plus I asked him if he had any particular wishes about his involvement throughout any peeing on sticks and he said he didn't mind.

However, I'm starting to feel like I could use some support. I haven't told anyone else we're trying and I feel it would be nice to have someone to talk to about being so hyper-aware of my body, about trying not to get my hopes up, about having hopes despite trying not to get excited. 

What have you all done? Are you keeping it more to yourself so you can surprise him? Do you tell him about all the ins and outs? Do you feel you get enough support if you do? Or have you maybe told a friend or someone? 

Because we decided we'd keep it to ourselves. But even if I still keep it a surprise for him, it would be nice to have someone to talk to about the process. Also I'm not sure how to get more support from my partner because I don't know what I need from him! I'm so confused! Would love to hear how other people are handling it.",t3_ihuga9
639,TryingForABaby,"Hey everyone, first time posting.

My husband and I started TTC Oct 1st 2019, I was on the Nuvaring for 8+ years. Everything seemed fine, but last month (end of July 2020 beginning of August) I had a 50 day cycle and got major acne all over my face (forehead, neck, under ears) and some of them hurt. I got BFN and a cruel AF with major back pain. 

Now I’m only 17 days into this new cycle and got positive OPK tests 3 days in a row and the acne hasn’t got any better, I’m wondering if I might be PCOS but I just moved and can’t get checked anytime soon by my existing doctor... anyone else have acne show up late in TTC? 

Am I overthinking it? Would love others opinions 🥰

Thanks 🙏🏻",t3_ihvidi
640,TryingForABaby,"So I was going to try to make this the cycle that I really focus on eating healthy, exercise, staying positive, etc. more than I have in previous cycles. I’m only on CD2 and have been dealing with a lot of stress already - work stuff, personal stress and of course there’s always stress related to TTC.

I had heard of people using meditation in TTC and wanted to hear some more thoughts on it. Are there any apps you would recommend? Anything you’ve tried that you felt worked or didn’t work?

What about meditation that’s specifically for fertility? Someone mentioned they tried a TWW-specific meditation session and it only made them focus more on the waiting and caused more stress.",t3_ihx4y5
641,TryingForABaby,"Thank you all for the love and support you gave when I posted about my miscarriage. It’s comforting to know that I’m not alone, and everything I’m feeling is valid. 

After taking the misoprostol — medicine that stimulates the uterus and helps expel its contents, going through the most excruciatingly physically and emotionally painful experiences of my life, being in bed rest, and having more than 2 glasses of wine—  I’ve had a few epiphanies. 

1. This is so extremely common, and no one talks about it. Close to 1 in 5 pregnancies end in miscarriage and this makes this journey to motherhood so much harder and lonelier. I suppose we don’t talk about it because it is so painful, but also at least for me — I’m still blaming myself. 
2. I have so much to be grateful for, despite this shit show. I have a beautiful marriage (as evidenced by my husband who literally bathed me today), we’re getting a dog, we just bought another house, and I have so many people I can lean on. This experience has taught me to act with kindness and empathy — even to myself, which has been the hardest. You never know what battles people are fighting, and the pregnancy loss battle is brutal. I would not wish it on even the worst human on the planet. 
3. I will be a much more adamant and stern advocate for my healthcare going forward. I will demand care, even if the doctor doesn’t want to comply with my request. One lesson I learned through this is that had I DEMANDED a dating and viability scan after being told they don’t do them for low risk pregnancies early on, this would not have happened. Hindsight 20/20, of course, but now I know better. 
4. Lastly, and this may be just me — but this deeper reaffirmed and justified my lack of faith and even a new hatred in any higher power. If god does exist, fuck this most unethical garbage deity. The Flying Spaghetti Monster would not stand for this.",t3_ihbafv

I stopped wearing perfume and switched my deodorant and been careful with my makeup/skin care products.

644,TryingForABaby,"I seriously admire the strength of anyone who has been trying for years on end, or just in general because I just feel like I’m not cut out for this. I’m 9-10dpo today with another BFN, I know it’s still early but I’m really just feeling like I’m out again this cycle. This process has been completely exhausting and draining and I think I’m getting to a point where I just don’t think it’s ever going to happen for us. I’m 24, my spouse is 24, and I just thought this was going to be so much easier since we’re still young. I went through my second miscarriage back in March, and I thought for sure we’d be pregnant again by now.

I just can’t stop obsessing over symptoms and tests and just wanting to be a mom and have a family. Each month it’s a symptom or a “sign” that makes me think this is it, and each month it’s a blazing negative followed by countless trips to the bathroom to see if maybe I just missed that second line or didn’t give it enough time. Everyone around me is either pregnant or is announcing a pregnancy, and it’s just becoming so overwhelming. I feel absolutely insane. 

We already know IVF isn’t going to be an option because of finances, and I don’t even know if I’d be a candidate for IUI with my PCOS not to mention I’m a little overweight. I just feel like there’s no hope for us anymore, and I just don’t know how to decide whether I want to keep doing this or if I want to give up.

I just want to be a mom. I love the life I live, I have a great job, a great partner in life, amazing friends and family, but as long as I’m not a mother that piece will always be missing. I’m meant for motherhood, I would be a great mom. It just doesn’t make sense why something I feel I’m meant for just isn’t happening.

Not creamy. I guess sticky? Gotta dig up by my cervix to even see anything, not much ever really comes out into my underwear (sigh, I remember when it did back when I was a teenager).

659,TryingForABaby,"I tried posting on the PCOS group without much luck — New to my PCOS diagnosis and looking for an informative documentary or video to watch.

I was diagnosed with PCOS almost a week ago. I'm newly 30 and my husband and I have been TTC for almost 7 months. Even though I knew my cycles were getting longer ever since getting off of hormonal birth control and my luteal phase has not been improving (e.g. my temperature hasn't been rising quickly enough, LP has become shorter, etc.), the diagnosis still took me by a bit of a surprise. BUT I was releived to at least be able to make a game plan with my RE and am trying to remain positive about the cycles to come. 

I'm just curious if anyone knows of a good documentary or a ""go-to"" video that kind of helps you (as well as your partner) understand the diagnosis more?

Anyway so I recently started using Fertility Friend and was signed up for the emails as well. I found that included in the app is a series of “lessons” about fertility. While I have found a lot of info on my own researching independently (and via this reddit page) I found that these are pretty thorough and useful. The coolest part is, they have converted them to a podcast! I have been listening to one or two a day in the car on Spotify, as they are only about 5 minutes a piece. They even have little quizzes you can take after to see if you actually got it all (which I have been using to grill my husband lmao.) I already know most of the info, but it’s a great refresher, and even better resource if you’re here just getting prepped or newly starting out. I wish I had known about it earlier!

The podcast is “charting your way to conception” on spotify and it covers SO MUCH: cycle phases, tools, BBT, CM, etc.

I started birth control due to wildly irregular periods, but those two months I came off of it around 4 years ago were pretty normal.

680,TryingForABaby,"Hi everyone! I’ve been a long time lurker because I’ve been ready to TTC for a long time, but my husband wasn’t quite ready. We agreed on April, but then when Covid first started he was very nervous (he’s a first responder). Now he feels more comfortable because of the amount of PPE he wears (and that I will wear when I go back to school next week as a teacher) and the precautions that are in place. I spoke to my OBGYN about safety during TTC during a pandemic with our specific jobs and she was optimistic about it saying that she felt as long as we were taking the necessary precautions everything should be good! 
So! Now we decided tentatively on November, mainly because my dose of lexapro was increased during the pandemic, but my psychiatrist is going to slowly wean me down to half of what I take now, which she feels would be safe for pregnancy. 


Anyway TL;DR I’ve got 2 months to prepare, I’ve read a ton on here, online, and in books but I wanted to know your own personal advice- what did you do to prepare for TTC that you feel is worthwhile? / what would you have done differently?

I feel so bad for envying her .. But the feeling just won't go. I never thought I would become this person. Here I am married for 2 years, all my tests clear and nothing seems to be working...yet for some it happens within weeks. My husband's cousin got married the same time as us, her husband had to travel back within a week of the wedding, and she got pregnant in that one week! Her baby will be two this year!

683,TryingForABaby,"I haven’t actually posted here before. Didn’t feel like I had been trying for long enough to rant, but I need some place to vent because I feel like I’m starting to drive people around me crazy. 

We started trying in October 2018, had a first trimester mmc in December and haven’t been able to get pregnant since. After my D&amp;C I ended up hospitalized for 2 weeks with excruciating pain, but they never found anything wrong, and all my tests came back normal. We’ve been seeing a naturopath for about a year, trying acupuncture and holistic methods until we could get into a fertility clinic. Due to covid our fertility appointment kept getting pushed back and were just finally getting tests done this month. By the end of next week I’ll have all new bloodwork done, a sonohysterogram and my husbands SA will be done... so hopefully we’ll have some news. I honestly don’t care if it’s good or bad, I just want more information so that we can make a plan. 

I know I should be feeling excited and hopeful that things are moving forward, but I feel more down this month than I have ever felt. Our closest friends who got pregnant at the same time as us in 2018, and now have a perfect baby boy, just announced that they’re expecting twins in March and I don’t want to get out of bed. 

I’m so sick of peeing on sticks and having scheduled sex, and going through this monthly rollercoaster ride.   Had no idea how alienating this process could be. I don’t want to be this person that can only talk about having a baby, and plans every little detail around the possibility of being pregnant or having a baby. But here I am. All consumed and exhausted. 

Does anyone else feel like trying for so long has changed you for good? Like maybe the excited, optimistic person you were in your first cycle is just totally gone? So hoping that when we finally get pregnant again and get out of the first trimester, that I’ll be able to feel hopeful and giddy.",t3_igo7ps
684,TryingForABaby,"Hi friends,

After the whole round of testing, the problem with our (so far) 15 month TTC journey is likely my husband. Not only that, it's looking like he may have a rare genetic mutation which leads to production of amorphous sperm. If this is indeed the case, it is said that even with ISCI our chances are 2%. 

I know this hasn't been strictly medically confirmed, but I can't find any information that says there's much treatment for morphology, and there is absolutely no cure/prevention of globozoospermia. 

Needless to say I'm devastated. We don't have the money to be spending on something that has a 2% success rate. Additionally, I haven't been able to find any support for infertility that's male factored. I literally get hundreds of ads on my social media for ovulation testing, ""unsolving the mystery of fertility"" with diagrams of CM, all this other shit. How about, tell me how to deal with my husband's (lack) of sperm? Why do we always point towards the woman? I don't get it. 

I'm frustrated. I'm tired. I'm sad. I don't know what to do from here. And targeted advertisements are shit and should be illegal.

Does anyone else have experience with this? Is all hope gone for me? What should I do? 

/End rant.",t3_igkkph
685,TryingForABaby,So I've been doing opks for 3 months. And I think I'm already giving up on it. It's not that we haven't had any luck. It's my husband. My husband has prostate of a 60 year old in a 30 year old man. He has to take medicine to be able to pee or he ends up with a catheter. The flip side is it causes his sperm to go into his bladder instead of how it should. So I've been obsessively tracking my cycle. If i can catch enough of a jump on it my husband can sjip his pills for a day or do a lower dosage with no problem. According to premom I got a .5  ratio then It dropped down to like .3. So idk if I'm going to peak tomorrow or what. I spoke to my husband about like hey let's try anyway and he was like nah im good. We can discuss tomorrow maybe we can try tomorrow. I feel like I'm being selfish with this ting. But I'm also mad at him bc he's already picked out names. Decided what crib he wants us to get. But then when I say hey let's try its like nah I'm good. I'm not emotionally strong enough for this back and forth. I just want to not even try and give up on the possibility of kids in my future.,t3_igsb2s
686,TryingForABaby,"About a month ago I started a really awesome new nursing job at a surgery center doing pre-op. We do all sorts is surgeries, and yesterday I just hit the lottery by taking care of two women getting D&amp;Cs for miscarriage, in a row. You heard that right. I was a bit emotional about it, but the women I cared for treated it like any other surgery and weren't crying. And I was professional and put together, even though I was mourning for them on the inside. One of my patients was just an amazing person, and she really explained to me the entire process of what she went through and how she lost her twins at 8 weeks. Yes folks, hearing that it was twins really broke me. I told my supervisor that I cared for two miscarriage patients and she said, ""Oh just so you know, we have some coworkers going through fertility challenges right now"" and I was like ""oh really?"" Without adding ""hey I'm also trying to make a baby!"" I've said it before and I'll say it again, the prolonged process of trying to conceive will make you a more empathetic and sensitive person. I'm glad I was able to use that empathy yesterday to provide them with solid medical care, even though I could have easily started crying for them as I got them ready. I pray for all of us that we shouldn't have to experience what those women went through, and we should all get our dream families swiftly.

Edit: thank you for the positive responses. I was a little worried about posting this but it means a lot that you received it well and have shared your D&amp;C experiences.

692,TryingForABaby,"I got pregnant with my first. We bought a new, bigger home in anticipation. Our parents were over the moon. 

Today I am no longer pregnant, but actually I was never pregnant. Ultrasound showed no evidence of a pregnancy — just two yolk sacs. I was almost 11 weeks along. I’m still not bleeding. I’ve had no evidence of a miscarriage, and still have pregnancy symptoms. 

It really feels like someone I love died, and is the most emotionally brutal thing to have ever have happened to me, especially because my husband was unable to be at the doctors appointment with me. I think I understand what being depressed feels like now. I hate that I didn’t push for a dating and viability scan early on, because it would have saved me from 5 extra weeks of built up excitement, that I now also have to grieve. I hate this day. I hate this stupid year. I hate my body for doing this to me. I hate myself for going over every tiny thing I did the last two months to figure out where I went wrong, or even thinking that any of this was in my control. 

I know time heals this kind of stuff, but I don’t know if I see this getting better anytime soon. My husband has been my rock through this all, and I’m so grateful for him. I wish this was one of those vivid pregnancy dreams that I would inevitably wake up from, and realize everything is okay. This was only my first pregnancy and first loss, and I never realized that you could be forced to mourn a future you dreamed up.

700,TryingForABaby,"(FYI I'm using a throwaway account for this.) Basically, my husband and I have been doing the pull-out method for most of our relationship with great success. I have an orgasm first, and then he pulls out and we finish him off some other way. What usually gets me off is thinking about him being able to finish inside me-- because I come first, there's always the possibility that he won't pull out (I trust him, but the fantasy is still there). So I was really looking forward to TTC when we didn't have to pull out anymore... but ever since we started I haven't really been able to have an orgasm! I used to think it was all about him finishing inside me but now I think what really did it for me was the risk of pregnancy. And now that the risk isn't there because I actually \*want\* to get pregnant, it's fucking with my head. The sex itself since TTC has been really hot up except for the lack of orgasm. I feel like I'm building up to one and then... nothing.  

Apologies if this is above the pay grade of this sub, but I figured this is a pretty common fantasy so I can't be the only one.

703,TryingForABaby,"Hi!!

Currently on Cycle 5 of trying for #1.

Last month I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who specializes in fertility to get a different perspective &amp; support w/ trying to conceive. I just had a full blood panel done which confirmed that I likely have luteal phase defect (LP around 10 days). My TSH levels were at 2.75 and my doctor began discussing the need for thyroid medication to bring this closer to 2.0. With some research I read that a TSH under 3 is considered normal though I definitely recognize that 2.75 is on the higher end of the normal range. Anyway, being on thyroid medication seems like a major decision to make and kind of worries me as I’m not sure how necessary this really is. I’m waiting for a second opinion from my PCP but was curious whether anyone had any input, experience or feedback to share. 

For additional context: I’m 28 with no family history of thyroid problems. I’ve also had my TSH tested every year as part of my regular blood panel and it’s always ranged around 2.0 so this is definitely the highest it’s ever been.",t3_igoysf

706,TryingForABaby,"Hi! So I am wondering if I will ever get a truly positive test on a Wondfo OPK because I am always super hydrated. Last cycle was my first using OPKs and temping; the strips did darken around the time of ovulation but never truly reached the color of the control line. My temps indicated that I did ovulate, however. 

I am a water addict and am constantly chugging it, so I really can only test on FMU. But I've read that you're supposed to test for LH later in the day, not first thing in the morning. So my questions are:

What time of day should I use the OPK? Has anyone successfully confirmed ovulation and/or conceived without getting a truly ""positive"" result on an OPK? What am I doing wrong?!?! 

I'm not willing to give up water or hold my pee for 3 hours straight lol. Currently chugging grapefruit juice along with the water - that stuff really does increase EWCM! Kind of amazing.

Now their website has a new TTC-specific lube and the one I’m using says nothing about being fertility-friendly. 

Should we just try and not use lube at all? I don’t really want to use preseed as my husband prefers not to know when I’m in my fertile window - he says it’s a lot of pressure and he gets nervous - and I think the preseed would be a bit much at that point.

I wasn’t staying as hydrated last month as it was my first time using OPK strips. I didn’t want to miss my surge by drinking too much water so lube was helpful, but maybe this month it won’t be so bad.

It explains in details how the counterfeits occur. Basically, any seller that wants to sell through Amazon sends their ""product"" and it gets thrown in a bin with the direct-from-Amazon ones. When you buy direct from Amazon, the person or robot just grabs from the bin. So there is no way to know if you're getting the real deal or a fake one sent by a scammer. Its why reviews are so mixed on products with someone people CERTAIN its a scam and others having a great experience during the same time frame. Its common for household and beauty items and, as many of us know, pregnancy tests. Super cheap materials to create the counterfeit with, no guarantee of quality, and a somewhat high price tag and CONSTANT demand. A scammer's dream! Avoid Amazon if you can.

Since coming off the pill 4 months ago i've only caught my ovulation 3 times. 3 months ago I tested every day and never saw a positive (30 Day Cycle). 2 months ago i got my positive OPK on CD 20 and had a shorter cycle 28 days. This cycle i got a Positive OPK on the cleablue digital test on Cycle day 15 in the morning. i was THRILLED about this. Cycle day 16 in the morning i used a Cheap OPK (as you can't test again on the digital once you get peak) and it was negative... Thats where i started feeling confused.

Is it possible that my LH surge was only on CD 15? Or maybe it started later in the day on CD 14 (i only tested that morning and it was negative) or maybe there was a false positive somewhere? Really hoping i just missed the start of the LH surge on CD 14 and that it was gone by CD 16 when i used the cheap test. Also just bothered because LH surge came 5 days earlier this cycle

I'm now CD 20 So i am treating today as 4DPO. Today and yesterday I have had slight cramping and noticed patches of wetness in my underwear.. I've used cheap OPK's from CD 15-CD20 and they've all been negative (CD 19 looked like it was pretty close to being positive....but was definitely negative)

718,TryingForABaby,"This is half asking for advice and half a rant. My husband and I have been NTNP for the last two cycles and next cycle will be our first “official” cycle actually trying. I’ve been using OPKs and temping for the last two cycles. My problem is that I’m such a light sleeper! I often wake up a few hours before my alarm and have a hard time going back to sleep. 

A major part of the issue is that my husband has a habit of setting his alarm at 5 AM with the intention of getting up and being SUPER productive that morning. About 90% of the time, he just keeps hitting snooze until about 6:30 or 7, which is right before my alarm goes off and I want to temp. This has always been a really annoying habit that I’ve asked him many times to change. But now, it’s especially frustrating! This morning I told him he can’t be doing that anymore because I need to be better about taking accurate temperatures. 

Anyone else having a hard time getting accurate temps because of being a light sleeper? Half the time, I don’t even take my temperature because I know it’s not accurate. I get positive OPKs, but hard to confirm with BBT. It all sounds so easy when reading the BBT instructions!",t3_igdyo0
719,TryingForABaby,"Hi friends! I am hoping someone here has had a similar experience and/or can help me understand what’s going on with my body this month. My husband I aren’t officially-officially-throw-away-all-the-condoms-and-tell-all-our-friends trying yet, so I’m not quite ready to ask for feedback from my mom friends. 

I am tracking my BBT &amp; symptoms daily, and using OPK’s as I get closer to predicted ovulation to narrow in on my LH surge and ovulation day. This has worked well in the past, but we’re still relatively new to this (only a couple months into our journey) so don’t feel like I’m a pro yet, and I’m still trying to understand the ins and outs of tracking and what my body does over the course of my cycle. This month, my predicted ovulation date was Sunday 8/23. On 8/16 I started taking OPK’s (clear blue advanced digital, because I suck at reading lines and love the FMU testing). 8/16 and 8/17 were negative. On 8/18 I got a flashing smiley face, and have gotten one every single day since then, including this morning. I usually have 2-3 days of flashing smiley faces followed by a static smiley face and then back to negatives, I’ve never gotten this many days of flashing smileys in a row. 

Looking back at my chart I’m wondering if 8/18 wasn’t actually the day I ovulated - my BBT dropped a tiny bit on 8/18, then rose on 8/19 and has remained elevated since, although as of this morning it is starting to drop again. The 4-5 days leading up to 8/18 I also had my typical ovulation symptoms and markers (high sex drive, light cramping, tender breasts, egg white cervical mucus) which all stopped or started to drop off around 8/20-8/21. So, I’m thinking it’s pretty likely I actually ovulated on or around 8/18, and not my predicted ovulation date of 8/23. 

My question, then, is why would my clear blue advanced digital still be giving me flashing smileys? Has this happened to anyone before, or does anyone have any insight on why this could happen? It’s driving me crazy, not knowing what’s going on! 

Thanks so much friends!

720,TryingForABaby,"CD 2 here: bleeding away, enjoying not having to POAS for the next week(ish), scheduling my wax appointment for next week (😂) and mentally preparing for this next go-around!

I’ve been doing some reading on the [Sperm Meets Egg Plan](https://spermmeetseggplan.com/smep-step-by-step/) and I’m interested in trying it out with my SO, but like a lot of folks our libidos have taken a bit of a hit in 2020 and so I have some questions/concerns before we commit to BDing more in a week or two than we’ve been doing in a whole month, previously!

(Note: I realize a lot of these answers will be influenced by an individual’s cycle length, fertile window, etc. Feel free to be as general or as specific as you’d like!)

• Start BDing on CD 8 - Why CD 8? Is this just assuming your period ends on CD 7? Obviously there’s no way to ovulate so close to your period’s end, so is it really imperative to begin this early?

• Daily testing with OPKs beginning on CD 10, BD every other day - Makes sense to me, gotta have sperm waiting for the egg, whenever it may arrive!

• Postive OPK, BD 3 days in a row - This part is throwing me off a bit only because I use CBAD instead of just LH strips. I’m assuming a positive on my CBAD would be the day I get my Peak result, yes?

• Skip a day and BD one more time - Is this just in case you ovulated late? In that case, is BDing just once more enough? Or should you do it O+1 and O+2 just to be safe?

Any tips, tricks, or advice will be greatly appreciated :)",t3_igd7l0

I have only been actively trying for a few months, and it is so hard in so many ways to stay positive and to not let the negativity consume you. I spend most of my days wondering if it’s really worth all the pain, but then I see you all who keep going and it pushes me to not give up. 

You all are so strong. This journey can be absolute hell. And the fact that so many of you keep on going, through all the shit is admirable. Know that I see you, and respect the hell out you! 💕

Edit: I want to add apologies to anyone who may feel like this post rubs salt in the wounds, or anything like that. I made this post because I rarely if ever hear of people talk about these struggles outside of the internet. Struggling to have a child often is either tip toed around or outright ignored. I have a few people in my own life that have gone through this, and until it was me trying (without success) I didn’t really understand and appreciate what they had gone through. I want to reach out to them to acknowledge their struggle, as I did here today, but of course depending on your own experiences, that can come off in a multitude of ways, not all good.

725,TryingForABaby,"The last two nights, I took ovulation tests for the first time.  I've been tracking everything with an app, which I know aren't always accurate.  Plus I am only on cycle 2 after stopping birth control.  My app says I am in my fertile window, so I wanted to take the test to see how accurate it was.

Anyway, the test instructions said if the second line appears and is darker than the first line, you are ovulating.  If it's faint or not there at all, you are not.

Two nights ago, the second line appeared but was lighter than the first.  It said to test again 24 hours later, so I did another test last night.  There was no second line at all.  Does that mean I ovulated prior to taking the first test, and there was only a slight detection of LH, which is why the second line was faint?  Would that explain why a day later, there was no line at all, aka no detection of LH?

It seems like every time I take one, the line is the same. There have been a few days where it's obviously fainter than before but the past few days its been relatively dark (but not darker than the control). Does this mean I'm nearing ovulation? Or are these tests just cheap? I'm using pregmate brand. I've seen some negative reviews on it saying that the straps didn't detect their ovulation but I took it with a grain of salt since some don't follow directions no matter how clear. 
 
Cycle day 12 I didn't test in the morning like I had been so I took one after 7pm and the line looked about the same as the control. I asked some girls on my tracking app and they seem to think that could have been my peak but I don't think so.. my cycles are usually around 34 days. I'm going to continue to test and probably bump it up to 2 or 3x/day to see if it changes. I know my app predicts this week/next week is my window so I'm curious to see if it'll be correct. (I know its just a prediction and not a guarantee)

I have been on the birth control pill for 10 years, I got off last month, and had a regular cycle. I’m now on my first cycle without birth control. 

My husband and I started trying last month immediately after my last cycle, I’m tracking ovulation via that Flo app. 

Here’s were my concerns come into play, my husband and I are avid weed smokers, we smoke every day, and have been smoking everyday for 6 years. 
My husband will also come home from work and have a few beers and both tend to drink heavily on the weekends in social situations. 

Other than that, we’re both very healthy and go to the gym very regularly. 

Last night was my last night smoking before we start trying this cycle again. I would like my hubs habits to change for this too. 

-How much does smoking weed/ drinking effect chances of conception?? 
-Will things be different if we both stop? 
-Should I start taking prenatals?

I’m worried I won’t be able to get pregnant because of how much weed I’ve smoked. Maybe I’m just paranoid.

But anyways, I’m 1 DPO today and just feeling SO MOODY about everything. I’m feeling down because now we’ve officially been trying for 6 months (and again I know that’s really not long in the grand scheme of things), and there’s just this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that something is wrong. My husband is also starting to say things like, “Well...maybe it’s just not meant to be with the pandemic and everything,” which makes me worry that maybe he’s over the idea of doing this at all? 

Sigh. I’ve struggled with my anxiety for years and things have been rough since quarantine began. I miscarried the same week that I lost my job due to COVID and I’m starting to wonder if it’s my fault that I’m not getting pregnant again...I’m stressing myself out about the state of the world so much that my womb is like NOPE NOT TODAY! And on top of that, I know that if/when we do conceive I’m going to be so consumed with worry that I’ll miscarry again.

Hub had SA at the beginning of August. We had first appointment in fertility clinic today. Bloods and scan for me.

Talking to the nurse afterwards and she says nothing was untoward on my scan. I'm to go back on cd21 for bloods. We said we hadn't had SA results back and if she had them. 

He only has a few sperm in it and they arent moving. 

That's all she could tell us really. Next step is the Andrology clinic but right now I'm feeling very hopeless and could honestly cry if I let myself. 

The nurse told him to lay off the protein drinks, which he has all the time. He has dabbled with steroids in the past and I think this is what has caused this and part of me feels resentful almost, and then I feel guilty for feeling this way.

Has anyone handled this before? How did you survive an attack without taking any meds because you may have conceived and just don't know it yet?

She medically transitioned to female last year and began taking estrogen HRT for feminising. We didn’t do any fertility preservation - which is recommended because estrogen can sterilise sperm production - because we didn’t think we wanted another kid. That has changed.  

**Story so far:** We had hoped the fact that my wife hadn’t been on HRT too long and the fact that I appear to be ovulating normally would work in our favour so we could conceive quickly and my wife could go back on hormones (dysphoria is a bitch), but it looks like no such luck. 

First SA three weeks after ceasing HRT was zilch. The most recent one nearly 3 months after ceasing HRT is: Count 3M/ml, morphology 1%, motility 8%. Very low chance of conceiving naturally, and IUI isn’t a viable option when the count is quite that low. Recommended for IVF. 

So. Questions. 

• Does anyone have experience with IVF in Victoria Aus? Prices/time frames/recommendations?
• What do I expect from an initial appointment? What’s the process like? 
• Any recommendations for improving sperm quality? I’d like to do what we can to improve it.

TW: Miscarriage


My husband and I have been TTC our first child for the last 2 years. I've had 2 miscarriages and it took about 2 months each time to get back on track. 

Here's the thing, my husband seems to have very little interest in having sex with me. I'm always the initiator. I've gained weight in the past few years, so I'm not entirely comfortable with my own body and he knows this. I've asked him if he feels he's not as attracted to me as he used to be. He swears he is and gets upset at me for even thinking it and we've had a couple of big arguments about it. Our sex life felt much healthier before we got married (and before the weight gain). 

We haven't had sex since June. And I can count on one hand how many times we've had sex this year (only 1 miscarriage this year in Feb). I know I haven't applied too much pressure on the situation because I rarely do the ""we have to have sex now because I'm ovulating"" thing.  I don't want our sex life to revolve around my ovulation so I've tried initiating just when the mood strikes to increase our intimacy. But at this rate, I'm starting to feel like I'm begging him for sex.

He's mentioned in the last year that his libido has been decreased but he'll masturbate even when I'm asking him for intimate time.

We talk about our situation and he is adamant he wants to have a child with me and that he loves me. I don't doubt that. I just don't feel secure in knowing he's IN love with me. I'm honestly starting to feel like a human incubator. I'm debating even telling him when I'm ovulating anymore because I feel like if the only reason he has sex with me is to get me pregnant, I don't want to be pregnant in that situation. I've always wanted to be a mom, but I'm starting to wonder if it wasn't meant to be for me.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking for here, but I feel really embarrassed and uncomfortable talking to anyone else about this (hence the throwaway account).

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Did it work out for you? Am I missing something? 

Thanks for any advice or insight.",t3_ifvuvl

764,TryingForABaby,"Hi all,

I've been lurking around this subreddit for a while, but thought I'd finally come on here to chat :)

So, we started trying for a baby in March this year. Nothing had happened up until this August, and I've never once had a scare or a positive pregnancy test. Plus my periods are completely mad and PCOS runs in my family - so I thought I'd pop into the doctor to see if she could shed some light.

I just went in for the second round of blood tests and she's already started talking about IVF in my area (I'm in the UK) and what I'm eligible for. 

Now, I don't know if she was trying to reassure me that we've got options, but all that's happened so far is that I've got a diagnosis of PCOS! MY husband hasn't even had a semen analysis done yet. Is she getting way ahead of herself, or should I start thinking that I should be preparing for an infertility diagnosis and a potential round of IVF next year!

Help! Some reassurance would be lovely right now xx",t3_ifqxq0
765,TryingForABaby,"I’ve been on Latanoprost eye drops for glaucoma for many years. My RE and eye doctor said it should be ok, though the one maternal fetal medicine doctor I saw suggested I stop if possible because the eye drops contain prostaglandins which in large doses could induce labor/cause a miscarriage. 

But I don’t want to damage my vision during this process and the dose I’m getting is pretty negligible. My dad has lost much of his vision and really struggles so this is something that scares me very much. 

Now we have been trying for more than a year with no luck and I’m starting to think more about the eye drops and whether I should discontinue them.
Most people in their 20s-30s don’t have glaucoma so I haven’t seen many studies.

768,TryingForABaby,"Thanks for all the advice and support. After a last ditch fertility intervention (lipiodol HSG) I experienced my second CP of this year

I now have realised I may not conceive a second child without intervention. Mixed feelings, grief, loss, anger, rage, sadness, Insomnia, anxiety. 

First (Tw living child) child was  conceived after HSG. 5 years ago. The guilt that I haven't given her a sibling engulfs me every day. 

All my hormonal issues are balanced now and it still didn't help. Things like thyroid, prolactin. The lipiodol HSG didn't help this time around. 

So here we go off into the unknown world of ART/IVF. I'll be 37 next month. Two CP in the last two months makes me wonder if my eggs are done and dusted. Who knows huh. What I do know is I feel terrible today. Like seriously terrible.

I actually got pregnant on our 2nd cycle but had a D&amp;C for an MMC at 7 weeks. They never actually saw anything viable on any of my scans and I was bleeding off and on. I believe I probably started miscarrying right away but was never able to miscarry fully. By the 2nd ultrasound, they had put me on progesterone because my levels were low. My first ultrasound was inconclusive so they put me on it just in case. Since I’ve been tracking, my luteal phase is a solid 10-11 days, sometimes shorter. I was also recently diagnosed with Hashimotos and am currently on medication to treat my Hypothyroid symptoms. I assume low progesterone and possibly MC is due to my thyroid issues. So, how do I get put on Progesterone to lengthen my LP to give myself the best shot at pregnancy? Is that even the right thing? My ob/gyn said that I should let them know right away if I get pregnant again so they can run betas. She will put me on it at that point, but is she the right person to ask about putting me on it during LP or do we need to see a specialist? Next month, I’m considering seeing a specialist anyway, but since I did get pregnant, I’m worried they won’t take it too seriously.",t3_ifrmkb

776,TryingForABaby,"I've been trying to get into running so I can be as healthy as possible for myself and a potential baby. Yesterday I got about 3/4 of mile from my house before I got some of the worst period cramps I've had in years. Literally bent over a bicycle rack (adjacent to a playground no less) trying to breath and stop from crying. I tried to push through and walk home, but could barely stand so I gave in and called my husband to come pick me up. He threw on some clothes and came rushing over. By the time he got to me I was sitting in the parking lot crying. 

My first reaction was this was the biggest ""Fuck You"" from the universe. I had zero expectations that we'd be lucky enough to get pregnant this cycle, but to be stuck, hunched over from period cramps, in a playground parking lot was a real low moment. But then my husband arrived with an Aleve and water. When we got home, he immediately found some chocolate in the cupboard and made sure I got some rest. In the afternoon, we made a cake together and he joked that he can't wait to ""practice"" more next cycle. 

Silver-linings are that, while this wasn't the cycle, my husband is a real gem, we have an amusing anecdote to share together, and more time enjoy the process.  I know that it's still early days for us and we have many many months ahead of us, but this was a good reminder that we're in this together.",t3_if62bd

Now I've just finished 10 days of Estrogen and 10 days of Provera. This is different than before, especially starting with the estrogen. The last few days I've experienced the old familiar symptoms, and I started bleeding today. I feel like today is the first ""real"" day of this whole experience.

He was born with one testicle that never descended - his mother never took him in for surgery.  (I harbor so much resentment towards her for this reason - what F-ing parent doens't take their kid in for such an important surgery?!!!!). 

Anyway! he got the surgery in his 20s but I think his fertility is still affected - he once got bloodwork done and his FSH was 35!!!  Which is a really big sign of infertility. 

He tried to conceive with an ex for 9 months and nothing happened as well - they werent actively trying they just werent careful. Anyway, he has never had any testing other than the blood work done.

However, it’s hard to do that to your fertility doctor. Having been given the diagnosis of “unexplained infertility” a few cycles back, we decided to begin IUI. The first round was not successful thanks to 5 half-baked follicles who never made it past the size threshold. When I met with the fertility doctor afterwards, he asked a couple questions and then shrugged and explained that it seemed the pituitary gland dedicates resources to stress instead of the hormones I needed in order to prepare for ovulation... Aka “it will probably happen when you stop stressing about it.”

I am currently on CD28. Normally I would've started spotting by now, and would expect AF tomorrow. Because I o'd later this month (CD19, confirmed with consistent elevated temps) does this mean AF will show up a few days later?

793,TryingForABaby,"I have been meaning to post an update about my experience. I have posted about my history with spotting during my LP previously. I usually start spotting about 4-6DPO. I use clear blue advance and bbt to monitor and I seem to have ovulated every month I have tracked (the last 6).

Long story short, my struggle continues and I am so frustrated, sad, lost, and having feelings of inadequacy. 

I've had all the typical BW done. Everything came back normal, including progesterone. This honestly surprised me but at the same time, I've read that there isn't much consensus on what ""normal"" is and that it is difficult to test because of how much it can fluctuate through out even a single day. I had my progesterone checked 7 days after I think I ovulated. I think I ovulated 24 to 48 hours my first positive OPK and about a day before I started to see a temp increase. My temp tends to increase over a few days and not a sharp spike like I've seen on other charts after ovulation. 

After my BW came back all normal and I had another month of spotting starting about 4 DPO, my doc recommended an SIS to look for polyps. I had that procedure which I did post about (wasn't too bad over all). A small polyp was identified, my doc seemed hesitant, but hopeful that the polyp was the cause of my issues. 

I had a hysteroscopy polypectomy and D&amp;C under general anesthesia about a week later. That procedure was also not too bad. The procedure was done on my ovulation day for that month, which made me feel sad about wasting that opportunity. It was also a strange cycle in that I ovulated on day 19. I had previously been ovulating on day 14-16 on my previous 4 cycles. I use the clear blue advanced monitoring and it detected an increase in estrogen at my normal time (around day 12), but just no LH surge until day 18. I thought that was weird, but since it was a ""wasted cycle"" anyways, I wasn't too worried about it.

My doc said I would bleed for a few days after the procedure, but should still have some sort of period at my normal time and could try for conception the next cycle. 

I had nothing too crazy in terms of bleeding after the procedure and proceeded to have a period at my normal time, but WOWIE was it a doosy! So heavy I was worried and called my doc's office. They said what I was experiencing could be normal. 

Fast forward to that next cycle, I again had estrogen increase detected on day 12 and no LH surge until Day 17. Just like the previous month. I thought, well maybe this is my new normal as long as my LP is longer than 10 days. Well.... 2 things suck about this cycle:

1) I started spotting on 4DPO. 

2) I just started my period.... Day 26! My LP was only 7 days long. 

I will be calling my doctor's office on Monday and see what she recommends. I am really frustrated that after going through surgery, I am still having spotting AND now ovulating late and having short LP. 

The only thing that I feel I should add, is that I have been drinking every weekend pretty heavily the last 2 months, up until my most recent FW. I figured since I was having surgery and there was no chance of conceiving, why not?! Maybe that has added to my late ovulation??

I will make a point to post updates more frequently. I have a hard time finding information on this issue on the web, other than all the things I feel like I have ruled out (ovulation spotting, implantation bleeding, low progesterone, polyp or fibroid). 

....sigh....

Hopefully posting my experience will at least help others and if anyone else has had similar experiences I would LOVE to hear it. Or just some advice would be great.",t3_ifgj3v

795,TryingForABaby,"We’ve been on our TTC journey for about two years now. From NTNP to actively trying with Flo, to a BFP and natural loss at 13 weeks last October, and finally now to daily temping and LH tests. 

I got my thermometer and test strips in earlier this month and it’s been... interesting. I didn’t expect there to be a learning curve lol but I’ve learned that my method of checking BBT whenever I wake up (varies from day to day, anywhere from 7-11 am) is not going to work. I need to learn how to be more consistent with that. This was thrown starkly in my face today when I woke up early at 7:30 and checked it (96.86) then went back to sleep and checked it again at 11 (98.21). Consistency is definitely key here. Oops. 

I’ve also learned that I apparently need to ask my doctor about hormone testing because I have had positive OPKs every day since I started testing on August 9th. I’ve missed a couple of days but all the days I’ve checked have been positive, ranging from as low as 23% all the way up to my peak yesterday of 87% (according to the “intelligent recognition” feature of the Femometer app)

Because of the inconsistent temps and consistently high LH tests, the app is going back and forth between saying my ovulation day is today, and saying I ovulated on the 18th and my LH peak yesterday was due to something else. (Today is CD 21 for reference) 

I wish I had started this sooner because I just saw my doctor last month and I’m not scheduled to see him again until next year unless we get a BFP before then. I’ll be calling the office tomorrow to see what they recommend but would have been nice to have this information when I saw him.

The major community-specific rules are detailed below.

* **No BFPs (big fat positives; i.e., positive pregnancy results) or other comments about ongoing pregnancies outside the weekly thread.** TFAB is for talking about trying to get pregnant, and when you get a positive test, you've graduated! We love when community members get pregnant, and we ask that you post your about your positive test in the weekly stickied BFP thread only. In threads/comments other than the weekly thread, do not mention your ongoing pregnancy and do not link to your posts about it in other subs. This rule extends to both posts and comments, and includes any positive result, even if it's faint, and any ongoing pregnancy.

* **No posts asking other users to tell their success stories.** If you want to create a post asking specifically for success stories (*e.g.*, ""Has anyone else experienced this weird thing and then gotten a BFP?"" ""How long did it take you to conceive after this situation?""), please do so over on a pregnancy sub. These posts are soliciting stories that break the ""no positive pregnancy tests outside the weekly thread"" rule above. This includes asking for a follow up from a user who is planning to test soon. 

* **No ""am I pregnant?"" posts.** Do not ask the community if you're pregnant, either in direct or roundabout ways. No one, including your doctor, can tell you whether you're pregnant or not based off symptoms and/or charts -- no single symptom or group of symptoms is a guarantee that you are pregnant. If you think you're pregnant, you need to take a pregnancy test. If you just want to get it out, though, /r/amipregnant is a great place to ask these questions.

* **Don't ""bingo"" other users.** Don't suggest unhelpful cliches to others that belong on a TTC bingo card: ""just relax"", ""never give up, mama!"", ""why not adopt?"", ""my cousin's dogsitter's sister was about to do IVF but then got magically pregnant,"" etc. These are ""bingos"" because people who are TTC hear them all the time, and they are more hurtful than helpful. For further explanation, check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/d878k2/new_rule_no_bingos_examples_and_explanations/)!

* **Please be kind and think about the words you use.** Trying to conceive is an emotional topic and we want to respect others' opinions and views, even if they may be different than yours. There's no one right way to go about TTC, and we have users here at all stages of the process and with all family configurations. This is a safe and supportive community for all people TTC.

That I was 12 weeks along. And it was a boy.  It gave me a little hope. They had no idea I had miscarried recently. Hoping their dreams come true soon :)",t3_iep0q8
800,TryingForABaby,Can you have implantation spotting at 12dpo? I had brown spotting this afternoon once when I wiped. AF due Tuesday or Wednesday. I’ve been cramping since 6dpo.,t3_ifck4h
801,TryingForABaby,"Hi all, I took 200mg ibuprofen and then thought to look up whether I should be having it. Ovulation was two days ago, I think, and I read it's not recommended in early pregnancy because of miscarriage potential. One study looked at women who took it regularly, another had a wide range of doses. Does anyone know if a single tablet at this point is harmful? I'm leaning toward not worrying about it, especially since I might not even be pregnant, but figured I'd see if anyone else has come across something like this.",t3_ifchqt
802,TryingForABaby,"So I was supposed to start my period on the 16th, still no sign of it still today.  I've taken multiple tests and still negative. Should I just accept I'm unusually late or keep hope for a positive? I'm never more than a day or two off from my predicted start date.  I'm at a loss in my head and it's really messing with me.",t3_if87vr
803,TryingForABaby,"Hey, first time poster here! 👋

Me and my partner have been trying for a while now, however he suffers from delayed ejaculation which means we have been tracking periods/ovulation from an app and artificially inseminating via a syringe ourselves. 

I just wondered if any of you lovely people could give me advice or experience from any of you with doing the same thing? Stressing out but trying to remain calm that it will happen when it happens!

805,TryingForABaby,"I've started temping in the morning recently after several months of no luck. I've done OPK and gotten positives the last few months, had pretty good timing, and then nothing. So I decided to start temping just to double check that I actually ovulate. The past few mornings I've had temps of 97.01 down to 96.28/96.77 and then 97.01. One morning was missed and I think the 96.77 was maybe slightly earlier than normal because my cats woke me up. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has had direct advice from their doctor on what might be considered too low of a BBT. I've read that it could indicate Hypothyroidism. This wouldn't be the first time I've suspected that I have hypothyroidism. However, I was tested once, after my severe symptoms had long since stopped, and I was in the normal range. Ever since, I've been curious if thyroid can fluctuate enough to test fine when I don't have symptoms.  Of course, I always forget that question when I go in and I never really have bad symptoms enough for me to think about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone had advice from a doctor saying that below 96.5 is maybe worth looking into it being a problem?",t3_if7gnn

807,TryingForABaby,"My wife got the Mirena IUD March 2019 and had it removed July 16th 2020. She loved it. Her really bad periods went completely away and she didn’t have a period the entire time she had Mirena in. 

Fast forward to May and we decided to have it removed and start a family. We knew it may take time for her cycle to become regular after removal but we’ve been in a whirlwind of things happening that make us think she either is/was pregnant and we need help from others who have had Mirena or have recently come off HBC and were TTC. 

We started using the Glow app to track her “cycle” before she removed Mirena. We knew it was possible she could ovulate right away so we had sex multiple days up to the removal, and then multiple days on and after the removal. The removal was Thursday July 16th and by that Saturday the 18th, she bled for 3 days 18-20th. It was definitely period like....cramps, PMS, cravings and lots of blood. We temped using a very good BBT thermometer. She spiked on the 20th about .8 degrees which we think was ovulation. Then about 6 days later on the 26th, she had a streak of blood which we were convinced was implantation bleeding. She never has any spotting between periods. Her periods are normally heavy, some cramping, but she normally doesn’t have any side effects PMS such as hunger , breast tenderness, etc. 

From that last week of July through to now 2nd week of August, she’s had every pregnancy symptom under the sun. Irritability, debilitating fatigue, metallic taste, hyper sensitive smell(like smelling from one side to the other across our 2200 sqft house), swollen gums, major constipation, gas, burping, near vomiting reflux, crazy vivid pregnant dreams(she never dreams at all), her nipples and areola have increased in size and sensitivity. The big symptom was her breasts which are normally 40DDD looked much fuller. The weird part is...she’s now lactating out of both breasts. She’s never done this in her entire life. If she takes a shower and relaxes, she gets out of the shower and her nipples leak as soon as they’re touched. She’s even had it where it sprays when expressed. Now I know this isn’t really supposed to happen until much later in pregnancy but given she’s never done this until we started TTC, we’re dumbfounded. Also, during this whole time from bleeding to now, she’s been OPK testing with no definitive positives up until now which I’ll detail in next paragraph. Also, no BFP on any Pregmates sticks or Clear Response HPTs, hence why we’re at a loss. 

Now fast forward a bit while we do the TWW for her period. If we take the 3 days bleeding in July 18th-20th as a period, Glow says her period should’ve been this past Saturday August 15th.  No AF at all which as of today August 23rd means she’s 8 days late. She’s had tons of cramping, breast sensitivity, irritability and pains moving around from her uterus(stretching, tugging pains). 

Here’s the weird kicker...August 10th last week she got 2 VERY positive LH Pregmate OPK tests. Using the Glow app to snap a pic, it also used pictorial analysis on the control and test line and it also determined super positive LH surge in the app. So naturally, we had sex every day for the next couple days to cover whenever she decided to ovulate. She’s also got elevated BBT up in the mid 98’s when she’s usually in the mid to low 96’s consistently. 

Today, she even commented that she tastes “dimes” in her mouth, hinting at metallic taste. If we concede then she had really late ovulation around ~CD24-26 August 11th, then we might be in the TWW stage. But then we question what the hell the other symptoms were earlier. 

We’re really looking for answers here if anybody has any advice. Still too early to test if that’s the case that she ovulated super late but we’re up and down with emotions because we’re really trying not to have confirmation bias and symptom watch but given we’ve been together almost 11 years, I know her normal symptoms and can see when she’s off nominal. 

Anybody have any advice coming off Mirena/HBC and experiencing similar symptoms? Could something be wrong and we need to see the doctor? Or should we wait?",t3_ifay0s
808,TryingForABaby,"Hello all! Not even sure if I can post here or where to post.

I’m new to reddit I only got the app because I was struggling to find forums for people with fertility issues trying for a baby. I’m very nervous and on so many hormones I don’t feel like myself these days. I had my first IUI on the 11th of August after just trying to get my eggs to grow for 2 months straight. I can take a test on Tuesday but I don’t feel anything inside idk how I’m supposed to feel and I’m just discouraged I guess.",t3_ifac1m

My sex drive has already improved tremendously. I am on CD14 and started using OPK to test 3 days ago. So far no positives but my line is better darker. Does that mean anything? ... Anyway my real question is for anyone who was previously on HBC, how long did it take to ovulate that first time? Just curious, I know everyone is different.",t3_if2g54

811,TryingForABaby,"Last week at 8 weeks I found out I had a blighted ovum.   I’m currently waiting to miscarry the gestational sac.  While I am very sad, I don’t want to be consumed by trying to conceive again.  I had bleeding at 4 weeks and I spent the following month on pins and needles waiting for my 8 week ultrasound.  It was emotionally exhausting and I don’t want to go through that again.

My doctor told me that I can start trying after my next normal period.  My husband and I want to try again, but I don’t want it to become something where I am stressed out and disappointed for months on end.  I am booking an appointment with a therapist and I am beginning a race training program.  But knowing myself, I am concerned that despite all the distractions I provide myself, I will constantly be thinking about.

812,TryingForABaby,"Have one child who is 3 and are trying for another. I've been tracking my cycles through the Flo app and just bought a clearblue opk digital kit. 

The kit says to use during first pee of the morning but I woke up in the early morning and had to pee so badly I totally forgot. I waited 4.5 hours and tested, but it said low fertility. This is strange because according to Flo I am 3 days away from ovulation.

Any thoughts on misalignment here between Flo and the OPK results?",t3_if4ouz
813,TryingForABaby,"My husband and I have been officially trying for 8 cycles now, and NTNP for 2.5 years. Never had even a hint of a positive test. After really thinking the past cycle, we’re deciding to go back to very relaxed NTNP. I’m putting away the ovulation tests I waited months to get in the mail (we are expats and can’t find them in our host country), planning on using my app only to input CD1 dates and no symptoms or sex, and going back to having spontaneous and untimed sex. For us, we really just realized that we are only 25. We live as expats and travel 4+ times a year. We’d like to move to another new country sometime relatively soon. 

The country we live in now is absolutely fantastic for young families. Compared to America, the maternity leave is great. Lots of kid friendly activities, fabulous hospital right down the road. But that doesn’t mean we NEED to have a baby. I’ve been a person to take life fast and by the horns - graduated HS and college early, moved to a new state for two years, got married relatively young, then moved abroad. We’re having fun. There are lots of years to have babies ahead of us. We talked and really considered - what’s the harm in just waiting 3-5 more years? What’s the rush? Why not spend more time learning about ourselves, traveling without kids (we are SO looking forward to traveling with our babies someday; but someone on Reddit mentioned how traveling with kids is just parenting in another place), saving more money, and enjoying each other in our marriage without a child? 

We both really want kids. But I think we just decided to stop rushing it. I’m not going to go back on birth control because I did not enjoy the pill and I’m not sure we’re ready for a permanent solution like an IUD. Our plan is to just enjoy being us, enjoy each other, and enjoy our youth. We’re not ruling out taking it month by month, either - maybe there will be some months that we do actively try, mixed with months that we avoid. I’m not going to keep my expectations too high since, as I mentioned, we haven’t had any luck despite NTNP for two years before the 8 months of active trying. Something may be medically wrong, but we can wait before we diagnose and try to figure that out. I’m sad and excited about this decision; last night I had a dream that we had a newborn baby boy and I just kept looking at his sweet pink skin and going “oh my gosh, he’s just absolutely perfect.” We are both so excited for it, but this will be a good lesson for us to enjoy being present, not focusing so much on the next “step” or what’s to come, and just being patient. I’m excited at the new possibilities - we now are considering moving to another new country sooner than we previously thought (because now we’re not planning on having a baby in the near future). I’m excited to stop stressing about it and just focus on myself and having fun while I’m in my 20’s.

816,TryingForABaby,"I've been off birth control for a year, and actively trying/keeping track of cycles since Christmas. My family has a history of hypothyroidism, seen friends and family go through struggles of infertility and miscarriages (1 in 3 women will experience a miscarriage. Did you know that?) and decisions on whether they want families or not. I hear friends putting down their husbands/partners and overshare details of others' struggles. Hearing birth nightmarish stories and the weird bodily functions that go on with moms and babies makes me queasy.
And still, I feel like I'm missing out. Despite all the shit that goes on with birth and babies and relationships, I want to be part of it. I want to be a good mother. I want to have children, because I want to pour into someone, partnered with my husband to share in the joys and dreams we have and learn from a new experience.
But I feel alone. I'm worried I can't have kids because of my medical issues which haven't been confirmed despite tests and tests and tests. I don't know who to talk to either, with all these fears and hopes and dreams without being placed in some sort of box.
I don't have close gal friends. I've never had a best friend except my husband. So who do I talk to?
Tonight, with hubby gone for the weekend, I'm drinking wine on the 58th day of my cycle, pregnancy test negative, no period, feeling broken and alone and a bit hopeless.
Maybe what I want to hear is that children won't make dreams come true (obviously) but there are wonderful things about where I'm at. Oh gosh, I want there to be good things for where I'm at. Right now it feels so far from that.",t3_iextbb

With ovulation, I know you get a positive OPK around 24 hours before ovulation (give or take..I have read it could be more like 12-36 hours).  So does the LH hormone stay high during ovulation? Or does ovulation normally happen when LH has tapered?

I know you can only confirm O by a temp shift, but my FF chart is confusing me...it has my ovulation date the same day as my positive OPK.

I’m almost a week late at this point, which is unheard of for me, and thus far all my pregnancy tests are coming back negative. It is completely messing with my head and with Father’s Day coming up soon, that stupid voice in the back of my head keeps illogically suggesting that maybe I am pregnant and it just implanted later.

The reasonable part of me knows that it will happen when it is supposed to, and if we were to get pregnant at any time other than when we are supposed to we wouldn’t have the baby we will have. I guess because we wanted this for so long before we actually started trying, even though I knew it could potentially take awhile, it feels like it’s dragging longer. Feeling all the emotions. Sad but also soaking up one on one time with my husband, because it won’t be like this forever. How are some ways you cope and try not to stress about it? Trying not to obsess but it’s definitely constantly on my mind. Thanks for getting through my rant.",t3_ievks3

Today I had a very much obvious positive. I guess I had two peaks? I’m assuming this one is the real deal. The only thing is around CD 20 I had a LOT of egg white CM. This peak (CD 26) I have next to no CM. The only ovulation symptom I have today is very mild cramping. This is making me second guess if I’m ovulating at all even tho I had that obvious positive and it’s frustrating my body can’t just be clear. Anyone ovulate without any CM at all?",t3_iew3zv
829,TryingForABaby,"Hi all, I’ve been lurking on this sub for 4 months now. I came off of HBC pills in April and we have been actively TTC since then. I have used OPKs (but not every single month), I also track CM and other symptoms. I gave up on temping as I have weird sleep patterns and sleep with my mouth open, but will probably get serious about trying temping again next cycle. 

Anyway, I’ve found everything in this sub so helpful and love reading the posts here! I have a bit of a personal/TMI question but perhaps someone else has dealt with this too. I know every body is different, but for me, I have some very obvious indicators that I’m ovulating - every month on O day I get a cramp, pretty significant bloating and some acne in the days leading up, and even a bit of a decreased sex drive. I rarely notice EWCM, mine just gets very watery.

I know TTC can put a strain on a couple’s bedroom life as it is. We are pretty active (every other day) during my FW but I’m just worried because that’s the week I feel least attractive and least motivated to do anything. I know other couples have mentioned how it can start feeling like a chore after a little while TTC... We haven’t really struggled with that yet but I’m worried we will since we are coming up on cycle 5.

Has anyone else gone through this or have any advice? I am at the end now of a brutal 2WW and I know I do put a lot of blame and pressure on myself. I am very much aware that statistically we only have a 30% chance every month, no matter how “right” we do everything. But I just can’t help thinking back and wondering whether this process would be faster or whether I would be pregnant already if I had initiated more or we had been more active during my FW. I also have some lingering fear that because my symptoms around O day are somewhat weird (don’t most people have INCREASED sex drive around ovulation?) there is something wrong with me and that’s why we haven’t conceived yet.",t3_iesud8
830,TryingForABaby,"Hi girls. I went to my OBGYN yesterday to get my lab results checked. My prolactin is high so I got a prescription for Cabergoline and the doctor said that I could keep trying while taking it (half a 0.5 mg pill every 3 days for about 2 months). 

Then I read the informative pamphlet and it says that you can't take it if you are pregnant, and you should wait at least one month after your finish taking the drug to get pregnant. I understand that I should leave the cabergoline if I get pregnant, but is it safe keep trying while taking it?",t3_ievzs4
831,TryingForABaby,"Disclaimer: I don’t know a lot of the acronyms, sorry.

So today is day 24 of my 28-day cycle. I am fairly new to TTC — we only tried for 5 months prior to my first pregnancy, which ended in miscarriage in February. This is our first month trying again after an excruciating COVID-induced pause; I needed a hysteroscopy/laparoscopy for an endometrioma on my left ovary and a bicornuate uterus, and that is, of course, elective surgery. My period has been normal after my surgery, save for one very light and short period that happened right after my surgery, which my OBGYN told me to expect.

This month, I went really ham on ovulation tests because I was excited to be trying again, and I didn’t end up getting a positive result, which I thought was strange. Then again, I did have an operation on my left ovary two months ago, so I figured maybe my ovulation could be a little wonky, as part of the healing process. 

Fast forward to today, day 24 of 28, and weirdly enough, my cervical mucus has been really goopy. Ovulation-y. On a total wild hunch, I decided to take an ovulation test. Positive. Wtf?

I have totally regular 28-day periods, and for the five months that we were previously TTC, I got totally predictable ovulation results that happened within two days of when they were supposed to. This is really throwing me for a loop. Is this something that just “happens” if you take an ovulation test at the wrong time of the month? If I’m really ovulating on day 24, isn’t it too late for implantation this cycle? I have zero reason to believe that I won’t have my regularly scheduled period on Thursday.",t3_ieqd1a

838,TryingForABaby,"Hi everyone!

Been a lurker for a while, I hope this is the right place to post this. Some background, am in my mid 20s and I’ve been TTC since about a year ago. Went through a painful miscarriage 3months ago, but my period has already reverted to my normal cycle. 

So I used to exercise around 2 times a week, mainly some light lifting at the gym. From about 3 weeks ago, I started exercising at F45, around 3 to 5 times a week. So obviously this is quite a ramp up, both in terms of frequency and intensity. 

I always thought more exercise would be good for me since my body fat level is rather high. My BMI is in the normal range, but my body fat % is around 35%. And if I recall correctly, I think losing fats helps to increase the chances of conceiving?

However, recently I’ve been having some spotting (dark brown colour) and I’m freaking out!! I’m about mid way through cycle so it’s too early to be pre-period spotting.

I googled and some possible reasons for mid cycle spotting are - ovulation bleeding, body clearing out remnants from my past cycle, or hormonal changes due to exercise? I doubt it is ovulation bleeding as I’ve never gotten ovulation bleeding before and I read that it is supposed to be light pink in colour. 

Has this happened to anyone else who started exercising more? Did you continue exercising and was your cycle affected? And should I continue exercising? As much as I want to get healthier I don’t want to inadvertently get amenorrhea... 

Thanks in advance!

P.S. it is not sex induced / implantation bleeding as husband is currently away for work.",t3_ienl3a

I am currently 6 weeks post op. I had 5 fibroids, the largest 6cm (2.3 inches). You can see 3 in the MRI picture and then there are another 2 behind my uterus. The biggest one is actually inside my uterus, and this is the one the doctor thinks was preventing me from getting pregnant due to lack of room for implantation. For reference, the bright white spot is my bladder. My surgeon mentioned my fibroids were not only pushing my bladder but also pushing my colon in the back. Feel free to ask any questions below, the least I can do is be a help to others. 
____________________________
Background: 
My surgery was on Thursday, July 16 at 9:30am. I was originally scheduled for August 14, but due to the virus and honestly impatience, I let my doctors office know I would be willing to take any earlier surgery. Luckily, the same week everything shut down again in southern CA, they called me on Tuesday and asked me if I would like to take a canceled slot on Thursday. I took it in a heartbeat as I wasn’t sure what my county would like look and if they would cancel upcoming surgeries. That same day I had to go into the doctors office to do bloodwork (pregnancy test, blood count, etc) and a local drive-thru facility to get tested for the virus. I also got a call from the hospitals billing department to pay my deductible in full. It was a pretty hectic day but I think it helped take my mind off the surgery. 

Day of Surgery:
Check-in at the hospital was at 7:30am. I went with my husband and he stayed at the hospital for my entire surgery. After a few questions and letting me know they would refer to my husband in an emergency since I lack an advanced directive, they took me back to start prepping. I changed into a hospital gown, the doctors and anesthesiologists came to introduce themselves, and I was able to see my doctor prior to the surgery. I believe had it not been these tough times, I would have been able to sit with my husband before surgery, but he had to wait in the waiting area. However, they let me hold on to my phone right up until surgery so that was nice to be able to text him and my mom while I waited. My doctor showed me my MRI results as I hadn’t seen the images (just the report) and I was shocked to see how large my fibroids were. It’s one thing to hear 6cm and it’s another thing to see it. 

After this, I was whisked away to the operating room. I only remember being in there for about 1 minute before everything went black. There was no countdown like in the movies, I just closed my eyes and went bye bye. The surgery took about 3 hours. I remember waking up to my nurses’ voice and being wheeled into the recovery room. She asked me my pain level, I said a 6 and she gave me medicine. Now that I think back on it, I would say I was in more pain that I thought. After this, I went to sleep. I woke up again about an hour later. She asked me my pain level (now a 7.5) and I asked to see my husband. He came in (he could only stay for 5 minutes due to the virus) and she told me about my recovery with him there since I likely wouldn’t remember. He took notes which I’m so glad he did because we referred back to them for some of my incisions. I slept again for about another hour and she told me it was time to try and pee. I wasn’t expecting to be bleeding so much but it was similar to my heaviest day of a period. She said this would last for about 2 weeks and it should get lighter. For me it lasted about 1 week and it was heavy for only a couple days. I couldn’t pee so she checked my bladder with an ultrasound and said I didn’t have a whole lot in there and that if I didn’t pee by 8pm I should come back to the hospital immediately. Luckily I was able to pee as soon as I got home around 4pm. When I got home, I changed into different clothes and immediately went to sleep. I woke up a few hours later and ate a light meal, took my medicine and went to sleep again. 

Recovery:
Having someone to help you during recovery is crucial. Getting out of bed was even difficult because of the strain it puts on your incisions and body. I took off the day of surgery and the day after. Then it was the weekend, but I did go back to work on Monday. Luckily I’m working from home and was able to do a short day. If not for that I would have taken a full week off of work, minimum. The exhaustion sets in so quickly. By Wednesday of the next week I had more energy. The couple days before surgery I meal prepped and did all of my grocery shopping and this helped so much. I took pain meds for about 2 days before I decided I could handle it on my own. The pain wasn’t actually that bad. What did catch me off guard was how painful the gas is that they put into your belly when it travels up to your shoulder and back. I read about this prior to my surgery and my nurse also told me this would happen, but it’s very unexpected and quite painful. That went away after a couple days. Because of the virus I couldn’t freely go for walks, so I would walk around my apartment until I got tired. I was able to shower 2 days after my surgery and it made me really tired but I was able to get through it. I remember when I came home from surgery feeling like even my phone was too heavy and I just had to close my eyes. Another big tip is making sure to have cough drops. Because of the breathing tube it made my throat ache/sore, and coughing after surgery is so uncomfortable so cough drops were a big help. Also, I refused to sneeze for about 3-4 days because I was scared and I read someone who said it was horrible. When I did need to cough or clear my throat I would hold a pillow against my tummy. 

Post-Op:
I had my post-op appointment with my surgeon exactly 3 weeks after my surgery and it was virtual due to the virus. She answered my questions and looked at my incisions and said I was healing well. I wish my post-op had been closer to my surgery but they said anywhere from 2-4 weeks after is okay. My incisions healed fine. One thing I hadn’t realized was that my belly button would be gone. I thought they made the incision right above the belly button or inside in the fold, but because they have to remove the fibroid in pieces they actually need the hole. So my belly button is now just a closed incision. It looks normal and no one would suspect I’ve had surgery.. but it is weird to not have your original belly button anymore. She said we could start trying for a baby again in October and she’s really hopeful that I’ll get pregnant. One other thing is my first period was last week. It was 6 days late, which is normal because I did just have surgery, but the pain was horrible. I had to take pain medicine which I normally don’t have to do with my periods. It was very short, 4 days, but days 2 and 3 were so bad. People say this is normal as your uterus is still healing, and I hope this gets better with time. 

Overall, it was a great experience. I wish my original OBGYN had been diligent and told me the severity of my fibroids when she first found them, but at least I’m here.. free of fibroids and on the road to trying for a baby.. again.",t3_iedf7f

The tests otherwise showed everything was fine (I was ovulating, husband's sperm was healthy and mobile) and there was no medical reason why we couldn't conceive (which was both a relief and very frustrating).

I've had an IUD in for a few years to help with uncomfortable periods. We are working with a fertility clinic, since we can't do it the old fashioned way at home like some of you. The fertility clinic instructs to get bloodwork 3 days after your period begins.

I just got my IUD out on Wednesday. I cramped really badly but didn't have ANY bleeding or spotting - none. The next days - Thursday and Friday I felt completely fine. This morning, I think I may have started my period as I have pretty significant cramping and regular period-like bleeding.

As this was my first BFP, I didn't have an ob on stand-by. My gynecologist refused to see pregnant women so I could only measure the urine HCG. Something didn't feel right though. Why wasn't the line getting darker?

Finally I got a hold of an ob, and he ordered blood tests. Yep, HCG low for a supposed 5w+0 pregnancy. I'm crushed, and today the cramps and bleeding have come.

My husband and I finally were able to get pregnant after almost 2 years of trying, but 2 weeks ago we found out the baby had stopped growing and there was no detectable heartbeat. After doing what we needed to do to grieve, I began to bleed. Last night I was heavily bleeding for many hours and passed out from what ended up being blood loss. My husband thankfully was right there and caught me without further injury and called 911. I was rushed to the ER where I was given blood and an emergency D&amp;C to help prevent continued bleeding. And now I'm home and just exhausted. The thought of trying again and potentially more issues is just too much for us right now, so we are done, at least for now. Maybe I'll be back in a few months once the trauma and grief has gotten to a manageable place, maybe it'll be next year, maybe we will just adopt. All I know is right now,  we are ready to just be with each other and be the fur mama I am.",t3_idm29c

868,TryingForABaby,"Hi all, apologies if this has been posted before but I haven’t been able to find any clear answers. 

So my understanding of how to find your coverline and O date is that your O date is the last day before your temps spike at least .2 degrees F higher than the previous six days and stay high for 3+ days and your coverline is drawn .1 F degrees higher than than the six temps before O date. 

That said, FF, which I use and (it seems) most of this sub and the TFAB sub uses, always defines O and the coverline different. Each month, FF chooses my cross hairs differently than I would. 

[Link to charts](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/CoffeeTree3)

If you check the link, FF chose my O date as day 14 for the July cycle and (tentatively) day 13 for the August cycle. But according to my understanding of temping, my July O date was day 16 and my August O date was also day 16. 

I know FF uses other factors to help decide O date, but my OPK Tests from July (which actually I think I did incorrectly) didn’t impact my cross hairs when I test removed them and in August, my CM seems to also imply a day 16 O date (no OPKs in Aug). 

So basically I’m wondering why - since everyone claims that FF is so accurate - they don’t use what I thought was standard guidelines for choosing the coverline and O date. 

Thanks!!",t3_iea4he
869,TryingForABaby,"I was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder about 6 or 7 years ago, but have been living with it for a pretty long time. When my husband and I decided to start trying to conceive I talked to my doctor about scaling back my medications because they could cause complications in pregnancy. I did everything right, kept up with counseling and got really serious about weening myself off of the antidepressants (Celexa and Wellbutrin and PRN Xanax) with a doctor's super vision and by January I was down to just the Wellbutrin and Buspirone which my doctor said was more suitable for TTC. By April I stopped taking them all together.

In June I started seeing a new OBGYN, and I told her I didn't think I needed them and that I would manage with other means. And frankly while struggling to get pregnant was stressful, it wasn't running my life in the way it is now.

At the end of July I started 10 days of Provera to induce a period which I hadn't had since December. The day after finishing I had a extremely heavy period (maybe it was just that I hadn't had one in awhile and wasn't used to it) but it was manageable. Unpleasant but manageable, and it also made me really hopeful. I was sure that this meant it was working, that this discomfort and pain would ultimately result in a baby. One cycle day 3, I started the Clomid and while I was aware there would be side effects, I don't know if I was prepared for the full force of my depression to come back. It doesn't help that I don't think the Clomid actually worked... I have had no positive OPKs, my temps are all over the place and who knows whats up with my mucus... I'm on CD 18 and I'm crying constantly.

I just feel so hopeless now, I'm not sure when I should seek professional help because I feel like they're going to recommend going back on the meds and that feels like giving up. My husband looks at me like I made of glass right now, but to his credit he's sweet and helpful and kind almost to the point of making me agitated. He's eager to BD even though I feel like a cave troll 99% of the time and I can tell he's be researching things on his own. And I love him dearly for that.

He has a daughter from a previous relationship (my step-daughter whom I adore with all my heart) and he showed me an old video from the Christmas before we met with her being adorable and unwrapping presents. I know it was meant to cheer me up, and it was something that he could look at and it brought him joy. And it really was cute and sweet and I tried to laugh and smile, but the minute I had some alone time in the shower I was bawling over it. It felt like I had lost something.

I know that this cycle isn't a complete loss, logically I know that. It could be late, and I should try to be positive. And even if it doesn't work this cycle I know that there are options still. I'm just sad and hurting and I don't even know why. I'm sitting hear wondering if I'm actually strong enough to keep doing this... Should I even be a mother if I'm this broken?",t3_ie40eo
870,TryingForABaby,"Hi! I hope this is allowed here. Sorry if i ramble my mind is wandering a lot today.

I’m planning on trying for a baby by myself in 1-2 years (depends on how long it takes me to become financially stable after the pandemic threw me off a few months ago) because I’m trans and want to start my physical transition before I reach my mid 20’s and figure if I wait too much longer my kid would be too young to understand why I can’t roughhouse if I get surgery at around 30. Im 19 right now meaning I’ll be 20 or 21 when I actually try for a baby.

1) Has anyone here done ICI at home? 

And

2) How should I start this conversation with my doctor? My next appointment with her is this Tuesday and I’m still lost for how to actually start the conversation.

876,TryingForABaby,"Update: I decided that I’m gonna wait and see what it does. I’m gonna make a follow up ultrasound for 1-2 months. I’d probably be more inclined to do the procedure if I have having more issues, but I’m not having any pain during sex anymore and my period aren’t bad. Birth control was off the table from the start. Thank you all for your responses!! ❤️

I had an ultrasound on Tuesday because I was having some pain. The ultrasound tech said I did have a cyst on my left ovary, and it looked like one on my right had burst. 

I had a follow up with my doctor today. So the cyst on my right ovary is not that big, I guess it didn’t explode. The one on my left ovary is 5cm, so pretty big. He said I have 3 options, wait 1-3 months to see if I get pregnant, go on birth control to see if it shrinks the cyst, or have a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. He said with a cyst that size it can cause an ovarian torsion. But I need to let him know next week what I want to do. 

I let my husband know but we’ll talk more in depth about it later. I told him I didn’t want to go back on birth control because I didn’t want to deal with getting off of it again.  

Also today I’m ~12DPO, period is expected to start tomorrow. I haven’t tested though. 

Has anyone went through having a large cyst? What did you do?

879,Miscarriage,"My beloved best friend and husband told me and my husband they’re expecting last night. My first reaction was nausea. I am trying to be happy for them, and know I will be when the baby arrives, but it was a strain to smile through the FaceTime and I spiraled after largely being okay since my MMC in July. Now, when I think about them expecting I feel an unfamiliar rage and want to scream. 

They’re going to be amazing parents, but were unsure if they even wanted a baby. They started ntnc because we got pregnant. I just feel such a sense of injustice and jealousy. I hate it. I want to be happy for them. But I’m alone (besides my husband who is wonderful but just doesn’t quite get it) surrounded by pregnant women. Literally every married  woman of child bearing age who knew about my MMC is now pregnant or has given birth in the past week. (The number is five of my closest friends if you’re wondering.)

880,Miscarriage,"My best friend since childhood, who's like a sister to me, just found out she's pregnant. I had a miscarriage back in June (first pregnancy), and while I'm managing my emotions okay, I often find things triggering. So far, triggers have been mostly impersonal, like Facebook baby announcements from acquaintances, seeing pregnant women out randomly, cute babies on the internet. But now it's 100% personal, and my heart hurts. She has mixed feelings about pregnancy, which is totally understandable, but it drives the knife in my gut a little further. I know it's not intentional; she wants to share this exciting and scary thing with me, and I want to be there for her too. I feel like I'm stuck between being totally involved and supportive for my friend (like listening about how bad morning sickness and crazy hormone mood swings are) and protecting my own feelings.

Does anyone have a similar experience with a loved one who's pregnant? Any advice on how to stay supportive while taking care of myself and acknowledging the pain?

It’s just an empty sac. I’ve cries about it so much before it was confirmed that when it was confirmed it was a lot easier to accept. However now I’m just feeling a little bitter.

2 weeks later I took a urine test and it's still positive but the line is lighter. Now I swing daily between accepting the diagnosis and then staring at my breasts in the mirror, trying to convince myself they're growing and the nurse doing the ultrasound was wrong and I'm still pregnant.

885,Miscarriage,"I’m going through a natural miscarriage right now at home and the contraction is bad. I found out I was pregnant 8/24 (LMP 7/9) while I was out of town. I know it’s late but my periods have rarely been normal so I didn’t check for a while. When I found out, I was in complete shock. My bf and I were not prepared at all to become parents financially or mentally. He suggested parenting because we had already had an abortion 4 years ago when I first graduated college, and he didn’t want me to go through abortion again. I shared the news with my mom and my mom suggested parenting as well since my bf and I have been in mostly steady relationship for the past few years. I went to a local pregnancy center and had my pregnancy confirmed at 7w. However, they couldn’t see anything but a gestational sac at 5w. They told me it was either too early to see or the pregnancy had stopped growing. I told my bf and my mom and they both told me it was probably too early. Since I was out of town and not feeling any false symptoms (the only thing was my breast tenderness started to lessen), I returned home with no worries. I started to think about baby names and how I wanted to set up the nursery. I shared the news with two of my pregnant friends. Silly me! 

However, I started to have mild spotting a week later and the spotting became more apparent day by day. I called my Ob and scheduled for a blood drawn. I was stressed because I also have no insurance. My Ob asked me to get an ultrasound the next day but I couldn’t see paying $300 for an ultrasound, so I scheduled a free one three days later. My spotting gradually became light bleeding. The night before I went to the scheduled ultrasound, I started to pass out tiny blood clots. I knew things were going south. Still, I went in to my ultrasound. The Sonographer saw the same thing as a week and half ago, she saw gestational sac around 5w, no fetal pole, no heartbeat, no baby. Even though they couldn’t diagnose me, I knew I was gonna miscarry soon. I was worried what if I couldn’t pass the tissue or sac cuz I really don’t want to go to a D&amp;C. 

The heavy bleeding started last night and the cramps were severe. This reminded me of 4 years ago when I did the medical abortion. I had several break downs throughout the night. I felt resentment, shame and hopelessness. Like many, I started to think if there’s anything I’ve done wrong - I was traveling and having alcohol couple nights a week, I was starting out a new work out routine, and I was driving several hours a day sometimes. My bf was trying to comfort me but I think we were just both hurting so bad inside (me physically as well). The night went on with me waking up to cramps and running to the toilet while he was awake all night. After 12 hours of torturing, I finally passed a palm size tissue with a gushing stream of blood. It looked a bit bigger than what I remember from 4 years ago (7w then). Right after I passed it, I felt bad pelvic pain I’ve never experienced before. I had some more bleeding. I couldn’t do anything but laying down to rest. I fell asleep for a while. Since then, my contraction like cramping had become tolerable. I just spoke with my Ob who was reassured me that the pain and bleeding will be less and less if I’ve passed out all the tissue. She wanted to see me in 4 weeks to do a blood test to make sure I’m fine. 

I’m now laying down and sharing my experience with whoever is reading it. This group had given me support for the past couple nights when I couldn’t sleep. Reading y’all stories helped starting my grieving process and I’m so sorry for everyone’s loss. I’m ethnically Chinese and miscarriage is still taboo and associated with bad sign (h, being pregnant before marriage is still somewhat taboo as well). But my mom has been supportive and cooking me food during this time. I’m not sure how long it’d take me to heal. I’m a pretty tough person - I was a consultant who traveled individually around the country, and sometimes internationally before being laid off by Covid. I’ve seen and dealt with so many problems. Nothing had made me feel as helpless as this miscarriage. I understand something was probably wrong in the very beginning of this pregnancy and nature had to take its course, for my better health, but I really wish there was something I could fix. I don’t know if I’ll share this story with anyone outside of my family because it’s so painful and I don’t want ppl to take pity on me. I know all I could do is just to wait for this is all over.

Update: I posted this after I thought I passed the sac. Turning out that was either the placenta or a large piece of tissue. An hour later I passed the actual sac. The sac looked and felt somewhat like a sausage (sorry if this is too graphic, but I was googling what these look like during a miscarriage and I couldn’t find a good answer. Again, I’m at 9w today and the sac was measured at 5w, if this helps). After passing the sac, the cramping quickly diminished. I’m feeling some back pain when I stand up/walk, so I’m just going to rest in bed for the next couple days.",t3_iqa8xf

887,Miscarriage,"**Trigger Warning: Mention of blood, Suicidal thoughts**

It’s been two weeks since I had my d&amp;c. You can read about my d&amp;c experience [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/igqvtd/my_dc_experience_during_covid19_restrictions/)

Compared to the actual d&amp;c procedure, finding information on the journey of physical and emotional healing from a d&amp;c has been rather challenging. I thought I would capture my experience in this post in case anybody finds it useful. 

**The physical aspect of healing:** 

**Bleeding:** I bled on and off for about 10 days. It started off bright red, and a lot more in volume, and tapered off to the darker regular period type red. I was wearing maxi pads for a week as the bleeding would arrive in spurts and be quite heavy for a while, and then disappear for hours on end. Exercising seem to set it off (which was only slow walking in my case) both the bleeding and cramps. After a week I was able to move on to panty liners as there was irregular spotting. I don’t have any bleeding now.

**Cramps:** I had intense cramps the first week. I would have sharp intense pains when walking. I did take Advil the first three days to deal with it, but it was making me bloated and retain water, so I stopped. I instead relied on a heated pad and resting to lessen their severity and just went on with things. While painful at times, there were never debilitating for me. 

I also experienced intense pain and cramps when I would empty my bladder or had a bowel movement, in the first week. 

**Bloating / Weight Gain:** The way my body looks even after two weeks of d&amp;c is the most upsetting aspect of this journey. I have had constant bloating the last two weeks. It goes up and down but never goes away entirely. I look about 4 months pregnant (which I was when I got the d&amp;c) and it is very upsetting as I am unable to fit into most of my regular clothes. Most of my bloating is around my stomach and butt. I weighed myself a week after the d&amp;c and seemed to have put on 3 kgs in one week. I don’t understand why this happened. I am now beginning to wonder if I comfort ate myself into weight gain? I was an XS before I got pregnant and am now a size M, all in the space of four months. 

**Hormones:** I did the HPT 5 days after the d&amp;c and tested positive. When I repeated it after another 5 days (10 days after d&amp;c), it was negative. So, I know that my body has cleared the HCG, but I am not able to understand why I still look pregnant. There has been no follow-up I was asked to schedule after the d&amp;c with my GP. I wasn't given anti-biotics and nor was I asked to schedule any US after. I was asked to reach out only if I have heavy bleeding.

**Sleep:** I found it hard to sleep more than six hours the first week. But I would also feel tired during the day and was routinely finding myself having unplanned naps in the afternoon. I would barely make it through meetings and wake up couple of hours later, sprawled on the floor. Apparently, I would be so drowsy I would lie down and go to sleep on the floor.

**Misc:** I did try to find information if there are any herbs or foods that can assist with physical healing after a miscarriage. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any information, other than the elusive red raspberry leaf tea which assists with uterus health. I found this particularly frustrating. Through the last one month I have been feeling like my body and my world is spiralling out of my control. There is nothing I could have done to prevent the miscarriage, and there is nothing I could now do to assist with my healing. I have also had a lot of hair-fall in the last two weeks. 

**The emotional &amp; mental aspect of healing:** 

My mental and emotional health has highs and lows. There are times when I seem to have made peace with the situation, and there are times when I struggle with dark thoughts. 

Tiny things like spotting the candied ginger I was taking for my nausea will trigger my grief. I made sure to pack away any maternity clothes, delete pregnancy apps etc. before I went in for my d&amp;c. It was my way of clearing away any triggers. Little did I realise that even spotting the fish fillets sitting in the freezer or the spicy sauce I developed overnight cravings for, would bring on the tears. I have now kept them away in cabinets. I found it hard to prepare or eat the foods I was eating during those four months. 

I find it hard to repeat the sweatshirts and clothes I was wearing in the last four months. I have packed them away, including the dress I wore for my ultrasound. 

However, I still have bigger breasts, a bloated stomach and butt. The clothes I wore just five months ago don’t fit me, but I can’t bear to wear the dresses and sweatpants I wore when pregnant. The stores are still shut here coz of covid19. I ordered some clothes from Uniqlo in my regular size, but they didn’t fit. I struggle every morning to dress in clothes that won’t remind me of the last four months and the way my body has change. A change that seems so futile, and like a punishment.

I’ve made changes to my daily routine in the last two weeks. I sit in a different spot to work. Changed up the essential oils in my diffuser (lemongrass and lavender). I wear makeup every day, wear nail paint (only black though), straighten my hair. I started to drink a bunch of new flavoured teas and eat different snacks. I really miss my gym. My city is working through one of the strictest covid19 lockdowns, and the gyms and shops have been closed since March this year. I am only allowed to go out once a day for an hour within my suburb for a walk. If the lockdown were not in place, I am pretty sure I would be spending a lot of time in the malls or at my gym. 

I have also been distracting myself. I participate in forums unrelated to pregnancy, I caught up on a lot of YouTube dramas, downloaded tiktok (which eats up quite some time). I am not sure if this is healthy way to cope. Distracting myself from my feelings. But it is how I cope. I find myself trying to forget I was ever pregnant. I have only told my sister and a close friend about the miscarriage. They msg and call me every other day to check in on me. TBH, I don’t like it. I don’t want to talk about it. I find myself talking about mundane things. And I feel judged that I am not performing grief the way they expect. They will inevitably bring up the miscarriage. I don’t want to talk about it. 

I also find myself day-dreaming quite a bit. I imagine myself on a holiday on a beach with my friends, or at a party with my friends, feeling beautiful, important and carefree. 

Working was hard initially, I found myself spacing out in meetings and video calls. I found it hard to concentrate. Attending video meetings and looking at the faces of my colleagues, trying to smile and act like everything’s fine was very hard. Luckily, I work from home, so I can take the breaks I need daily. It has gotten easier now. I can get some work done though I am no where close to being as productive as I was just a month ago. 

There was one evening, two days ago, when coming back from my walk, I started to tear up. I was alone, and I started to contemplate some dark thoughts. I didn’t want to live anymore. I felt like I was of no value and no use to anyone in this universe. I live in a country where I have no family or friends here, no support system. They all live in another country. I feel past unresolved anger and resentment rise in me again on certain days against family members or friends, generally around being ignored, or made to feel irrelevant. 

I had a phone session with a therapist last week. She’s asked me to schedule some time daily to journal. I haven’t done that at all. I don’t want to think back to a situation I feel I had no control over. It makes me feel helpless. My next session is ten weeks from now. 

I hope you found this useful. This was hard to type, but I did it anyway in order to create something useful from this negative experience. I send virtual hugs and healing prayers your way and hope you will treat yourself with kindness.

She rested for a few days, her bleeding diminished and the miscarriage symptoms slowly faded. Now in her 8th week, she has very light spotting and normal pregnancy symptoms have returned. 

Does this sound like we are out of the woods? Does a threatened miscarriage in any way damage the fetus?

Thanks to all that reply.

She is 39, first pregnancy.",t3_ipv2mg

893,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone.

This is my first post here and I’ll try to keep it short, but it feels like a long story haha.

My partner of 3 years has a child from his first marriage and loves him more than anything. He wasn’t sure if he wanted kids in the future- sometimes yes and sometimes no. He just knew he didn’t want them yet and that was alright with me! I was fine with waiting a few more years to decide as I’ve been on the fence myself lately.

I’ve been on the mini-pill for awhile now and was very good about taking it.

A couple of months ago, I found out that despite my best efforts, I was pregnant. When I found out, the test came up positive right away but I was already bleeding lightly. 

I told him that night and was nervous to tell him- I didn’t know how he would react. We were both VERY freaked out and nervous but he shocked me and was very excited and positive about the whole thing. I was pleasantly surprised and for the next few days, he was so incredibly sweet and supportive. He even named it.

Anyway, long story short, in the following days, the bleeding was on and off. I grew more and more scared as I was becoming attached to this idea of a baby. I was also feeling other symptoms too so I really started to feel pregnant. On the fourth day, the bleeding became really heavy and painful and I was beside myself with grief.

I ended up miscarrying while my partner was out of town. He was very supportive at first but the following days were really strenuous and tense between us. We’ve never been through anything like this and we both kind of shut down and just didn’t talk for awhile.

He came back into town and I completely broke down. I remember him telling me he was sad but mostly, he just held me while I cried and told me he was so sorry this was happening.

So, since then, I’ve been doing much better and our relationship has improved a lot. This experience has overall lead to a lot of positive outcomes between us, including more open communication. This all brings us to the other night:

I got upset again about it (doesn’t happen often anymore) and I was at his house. Again, he held me while I cried and told me he was so sorry. Then he asked if I had spoken to anyone else about how I was feeling and I said no. He gently suggested I talk to someone about it and when I asked why, he said he felt bad because he wasn’t as sad as I was. He was more “okay either way”.

I told him I was jealous that he was “okay either way” and that he doesn’t need to be sad if he wasn’t. I reminded him it was okay to feel two conflicting emotions at once: you can be sad and relieved at the same time. Or sad and happy. 

I really was okay with him not being as upset when I said it but now....everytime I think about it, I’m taking it really personally. Like maybe he didn’t care at all? Or maybe he really wasn’t sad when it first happened so now he feels guilty? 

Anyway, I know everyone processes these things differently and he wasn’t as connected to it as I was. It would make sense if he didn’t feel as sad but I don’t know how to not take it personally.

Can anyone else relate? Really appreciate you reading this and taking the time to share your thoughts or experience 💕",t3_ipxgbx

900,Miscarriage,"I am a 19-year-old college student, and I just had a MC today (it's also my birthday which sucks). I was confused yesterday as to why I was getting such a heavy, what I assumed to be, period since my birth control stops them completely. This morning, I thought I saw a large blood clot, but I soon realized it was a placenta. I talked to medical professionals, called planned parenthood, and did a lot of research to figure out exactly what had happened and what to do next. It was probably 4-5 weeks and I don't know if I have passed anything else yet. 

I have never wanted to be pregnant. It has never appealed to me and a lot of other mental health conditions have attributed to fears/resentment to getting pregnant. Still, I have cried all day with how shaken and upset this has made me. My friends keep saying things like, ""Look on the bright side, at least you aren't pregnant,"" but I just can't be happy about that right now. Yes, that is a very good thing, but it just doesn't matter to me. Maybe the emotions are from being so out of control of this or being so shaken by such an experience. 

Anyone had an experience similar? Even if your pregnancy was wanted, how are some ways to cope and move past this experience? Also, does it come out in any order and should I expect to see the sac come out later (I have no clue if anything else has passed)? I am not angry or upset with myself. I just don't know what to do or how to even deal with this since most articles online focus on not being mad at yourself/ moving forward to keep trying.

I didn’t use tampons during the MC bleeding due to the risk of infection/per doctor’s orders. They didn’t say anything about needing to avoid tampons for my first period after the miscarriage, but for some reason I’m a little wary.

Did you use tampons for that first period? I could use pads to be safe, but we’re going on a trip and I’d rather not feel like I have a diaper on/be worried about leaks the whole time. (Assuming my period even comes).",t3_iphct3
902,Miscarriage,"I haven’t been on this sub before; haven’t had reason and didn’t actually know it existed. Maybe posting will actually accomplish something, since talking to the people around me is difficult.
I’m 31 years old and miscarried my first pregnancy at the beginning of August, at 6 weeks. I went through the process as well as the doctor’s appointment alone, and continue to, due to Covid, and it’s a bitch. I’m heavily depressed and struggling on a daily basis to function, but I feel like at this point the expectation is to move on and let it go. Which I don’t seem to be able to do. I feel different, along with a slew of other emotions that I can’t control. I have started having panic attacks nearly daily and my depression has swung low enough to hit suicidal ideation multiple times. It doesn’t help that the people I’m closest with are paralyzed by Covid anxiety and can’t do in-person socializing, and it doesn’t help that I was in the ER for this on a Saturday and started a new full-time job on the following Monday. That job is the only concept of functionality I have right now, and I love the job, which is largely why I’m fighting to show up every day and not sabotage the one good thing that has happened this year. It also doesn’t help that shortly after I miscarried, a friend from adolescence died suddenly and then I was in a car accident that destroyed my car.
I am tired, and tired of feeling like this, and the people in my life that I’m closest with are childfree, which makes me hesitant to actually talk about it with them, out of fear of a.) them not getting it/invalidating it, or b.) being uncomfortable with the topic. I keep expecting things to turn around and feel better, and they just don’t. I’m angry and sad and exhausted.",t3_ipcflx
903,Miscarriage,"UPDATE: It's pretty much been confirmed that I had a miscarriage. My doctor came in the room and the look on her face was all that needed to be said. The way she explained it to me though really helped. She said that my body can tell when it is not a viable embryo and it takes care of it itself. So as much as this is upsetting, maybe there is a silver lining. I have an appointment to go back in a week. Will try to pass it naturally but if nothing comes in a week then I might undergo a D&amp;C. Thank you to all who have been supportive!

I should be around 9 weeks right now. Started experiencing some bleeding and brown discharge on Sunday. Went in today for my first ultrasound, which was scheduled prior to the bleeding/discharge. The technician says it looks like its 6 weeks along, unable to confirm heartbeat. She says that it may have stopped growing and I may have had a miscarriage. I have an appointment with my OB today at 1:30pm for blood tests and whatnot. They are going to send off the images to radiology and then to my OB for my appointment this afternoon. I'm finding it very difficult to stay positive right now. First pregnancy. Never ever really wanted to be a mom until I hit 33 last October. Now I feel like everything is turned upside down.",t3_ipi9yz
904,Miscarriage,"I had miss miscarriage at 6 weeks but it was discovered at 9 weeks. I chose to take the drugs yesterday. The doctor made it clear that a week later I should come in for an ultrasound to make sure everything flushed out. Well I barely got any cramps and filled maybe two pads. Today I have light cramping and what seems to be a very mild period. I called the office to see what should be done but my doctor wasn't in so the nurse talked to a different one. They're acting like they've never heard of cytotec not working nor getting a follow-up ultrasound. 

After condescendingly confirming that I took the medicine correctly, they told me I have to come in for an ultrasound tomorrow or take the drugs again. I can't talk to my doctor until Monday. I asked why I can't wait a week for the ultrasound and they said it had to be tomorrow for ""reasons.""

I'm not sure what to do. Has anyone else been through something similar where the drug didn't really work? I told them to refill my prescription for this drug again but I'm thinking I'll just wait to talk to my doctor on Monday.",t3_ipmtyl

906,Miscarriage,"Today, I was officially told I miscarried. My hormone levels that were 3000+ on Thursday’s blood test were around 600 on Saturday’s blood test. I knew I miscarried when it happened, but it hurt much more than I thought it would once my doctor said it. They want me to get another blood test tomorrow to make sure I’m on track I guess. 

I’m starting to feel angry about it all now. Why is this something that is talked about more? You see the statistics about it, but that’s really it. Maybe they don’t want to scare women, but I feel like I should have been better prepared for what happened. They say bright red blood and cramping. But they fail to mention that the bleeding is so heavy you can bleed through a pad in less than an hour or that you can pass clots the size of your palm. 

It’s a traumatic experience that I really thought wouldn’t happen to me, at least not for my first pregnancy. I’m 24 and my first pregnancy ended with a miscarriage. I was obviously afraid this could happen, but I just always thought it wasn’t something that happened to women in their 20s. I feel like health class back in high school failed me. 

Maybe I’m just ill informed, but I think that’s a problem too. My first prenatal appointment was supposed to be at 9w4d and I started miscarrying the night before. Maybe it’s all just because I’m mad at the world and mad that this was my first experience being pregnant, but I really feel like this should be talked about more being as common as it is. 

That being said, this community has helped me so much in the few days that I’ve been here. Thank you for being such a safe place where I can express myself with this unbelievable loss and get more informed💕",t3_ip4imb
907,Miscarriage,"We get “free” healthcare in the military. What this really means is that even though I knew I was pregnant at around 5 weeks and the Army knew. I didn’t even get referred to the OBGYN for about four weeks after that. Then they scheduled me for an appointment two weeks after that. 

The day before my appointment I woke up with cramping. We all know where this is headed. After my ultrasound at the ER they rolled me out into the hall and left me there for about 30 minutes. Staff and nurses walking by. I sat there. They said “the ER nurse will be back to pick you up soon” yeah right. Eventually the ultrasound technician had to roll me back to the ER herself. My husband couldn’t even come in to comfort me. I didn’t ever have a baby, just a pregnancy. If they had scheduled me sooner I would’ve known that and they could’ve saved me and my husband the heartache of feeling attached. 

WBAMC hospital in El Paso Texas has a 2.7 out of 5 stars. The reviews for labor and delivery are awful. Nobody recommends going there and I understand why now. 

This was back in June it’s just as my husband and o are deciding to start trying again I feel the need to share my story with others. Hopefully let go of some of my fear of trying again.

908,Miscarriage,"I’ll apologize for the formatting and how rant-y this may sound, but hopefully getting it out there will help. 
At 27, I was thrilled to find out I was pregnant, my husband was even more excited. Except being here we can all assume how this ended. It started about 2 weeks ago, just before my 8 week mark. I started bleeding and wasn’t sure what was going on. I called my doctor who told me to go to the hospital. They told me I had a subchorionic bleed and everything would be fine and to expect some bleeding. That “everything was fine until it wasn’t”. (When I asked what that meant, I was told I would know if it happened) 
That Friday i started cramping, and couldn’t get a hold of my doctors office. I tried the on call number they gave me, turns out, it wasn’t the on call number, it was the main admin line. So I figured I’d try again in the morning. Still nothing, except now it’s Saturday and I’m bleeding pretty heavy. I called the affiliated hospital who, despite explaining that I was unable to get ahold of my doctors office, they told me someone was on call and transferred me. I listened to ringing for ~15 minutes. 
I spent the weekend terrified and looking for any sort of help. 
Monday morning I was finally able to get ahold of someone at my doctors office, they tell me to go to the hospital. Once I arrived, the woman triaging me interrogated me why I wouldn’t just come when the bleeding started. 
Once seeing the doctor, she confirmed that I was miscarrying, however it was incomplete. She was honestly the nicest person I spoke to my entire pregnancy. 

My husband has been amazing through all of this, but I can’t quite seem to get a grip on how to grieve. I can’t help but feel slighted and left out in the rain by the people I was supposed to trust the most, and that this entire process was made so much worse than it needed to be. 
Other than the knowledge that this is something that commonly happens, there seems to be almost no information out there. 

But because my pregnancy was still a secret, I feel like now my miscarriage is.

909,Miscarriage,"My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over a year. Finally we had success with IVF--our first FET cycle, we conceived. All looked good at first. Today I went in for my first ultrasound at 5w3d and knew something was amiss when the doc called in another doctor to look at the screen--apparently the gestational sac was really tiny. Got the call a couple hours later that my HCG dropped significantly and it's a loss. Going to stop taking the hormonal meds. I feel kind of insane right now. This is so painful even though it wasn't far along. It feels incredibly cruel to have gotten this hope after struggling to conceive only to have it taken away.

910,Miscarriage,"As the title says, I’m currently having my second MC. My first was in my early twenties, and it was so early I didn’t know I was pregnant before I started miscarrying at work on a Friday. Now in my 30s, my husband and I have been trying for almost a year and a week ago I finally tested positive. Since, I had some light pink/brown spotting but wasn’t worried because it was very light and everything I read said that was normal. The bleeding was nothing like the bright red, heavier, clogged bleeding I experienced with my first MC so that helped alleviate my worries, too. 

I tested positive at home every day until my first OB appointment today. It was early (5w+3) but we were hoping to get an ultrasound. I tested positive twice this morning before my appointment but my urine test at the doc came back negative. She couldn’t see anything on the portable ultrasound machine and was going to have me take a blood test and vaginal ultrasound but when the urine test came back negative she said those weren’t necessary. She offered that I could still have them if I wanted to be 100% sure but I declined. Now that I’ve had time to think about it I wish I had gotten the additional testing! Now I’m stuck still behaving as though I’m pregnant and waiting to miscarry or get a period in the next two weeks or having to go back to the doc “to check on the pregnancy”.

He just keeps saying that he’s fine, that he deals with things differently than most. In addition to our loss, we’ve had quite a few personal setbacks(mostly that directly effect him). September has REALLY not been our month. And it’s only the 8th.  

He’s not the type to talk about feelings, but how can I make sure he’s processing our loss and not just burying it?

912,Miscarriage,"First post ever here. Kind of long.

I found out I was pregnant on August 6th. My boyfriend kept ""joking"" (before we even became pregnant) that it was going to be twins. 

I opted for an early ultrasound because I have high blood pressure and was feeling some cramps on my right side. At the ultrasound, the tech heard not one, but two, healthy heartbeats. I was almost 7 weeks along. How crazy, overwhelming, scary, and freaking exciting. I was in shock all day, all weekend really. Twins. Two babies. But they were diagnosed as mono mono twins, which would've made it very rare and pretty high risk. Due to this, my regular OB wanted me to see a specialist that comes to our hospital 2x a month. I got in for a follow up ultrasound two weeks from my first. 

We were so excited and although it was scary, we were ready. I didn't do much googling of mono mono as I didn't want to freak myself out. I did read on here some moms say their twins were misdiagnosed early as mono mono so I had hope.

Day of ultrasound; boyfriend couldn't join because of covid. I was prepared with questions and ready to get all the answers and figure out the healthiest and best way to get our babies into this world. 

I knew something was wrong when the tech stopped talking. I felt the room change and knew something wasn't right. She got done and said she had to talk to the doctor, but that she couldn't hear either of the heartbeats. I laid on that table for 10 minutes but it felt like an eternity before the doctor came in and confirmed that my babies had no heartbeats and they stopped growing almost immediately after my first ultrasound.  

Found out the babes were also misdiagnosed as mono mono. They were mono di, which would've made it a bit less high risk.

To cut to the end, I had a d&amp;c two days after finding out. It's been only 4 days since the procedure and 6 days since finding out. I am heartbroken.It's so strange to me that a week ago I was planning on twins and now, nothing. I feel guilty and cruel and that I rushed getting a d&amp;c but I felt waiting for it to naturally happen would have been a lot of emotional trauma for me. I keep wondering if there is something I could've done different, something better, so that they'd still be here.",t3_ip0j9q

I had a really traumatic experience before the surgery, they couldn't find my pulse and I was out for I don't even know how long. I was scared, and fought what I could, but now I wish I would have just let go and be with my baby. I know (too many) people go through this all too often, sometimes multiple times. I don't know how.

916,Miscarriage,"Hi guys. So my body finally started to naturally miscarry my blighted ovum (empty sac that measured 6.5 weeks) last Thursday at what was around 10.5 weeks. I believe the worst is over (passed a ton of tissue on Saturday) but I’m still having some mild cramping and bleeding with the occasional small clot. 

I’m also noticing what seems to be a kind of strange symptom as well. Sometimes when I go to the bathroom I get cramping pains in what feels like my upper bladder area. There’s no blood in my urine and no urgency. It doesn’t hurt the way a typical UTI would at least in my experience. It almost feels like my abdominal muscles are all just confused and going crazy. Or maybe I’m just going crazy... I don’t have a fever or feel ill at all so I’m kind of just in “wait and see” mode. I feel like there’s a lot of tension and cramping down there and maybe it’s just my bladder getting confused kind of like when diarrhea sometimes happens around a period but I just don’t know. 

I feel like this is kind of a long shot but I was just wondering if any of you experienced anything similar? Thanks for reading.",t3_ioy2ow
917,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone, I am at the end of a miscarriage (my first one) that happened when I was 6 weeks pregnant. The doctor could see the baby in the sac but the baby was too tiny and my hcg levels were low. My body naturally miscarried and everything is now out (6 days later.)

My husband and I are already ready to start trying again. He said the rule of thumb is usually to wait until I have a period again, but there is no harm in us trying earlier if we want. My question is, should I be given progesterone the next time I get pregnant? I’m so worried about this happening again. My doctor said that the cause is usually not progesterone and didn’t seem interested at all in giving it to me for a future pregnancy. In my mind though, I feel like it’s just an extra precaution that I’d feel good having. I had my progesterone tested a few months back on cycle day 21 and it was 6.3 ng/mL

Last Thursday I had a miscarriage. I was only 7 weeks pregnant and I didn’t found out until I lost them.

""miscarriage completed"" was what it said in the last echo, in that little photo they gave me confirming that my uterus was now empty. I have those words imprinted in my brain, from that moment until now I can't see anything other than that phrase, I can't hear anything other than the ""I'm sorry"" from my doctor and nothing seems to fill this horrible void of hopelessness.

It’s such a deep confusion to feel so close to someone you have never met except in dreams, how can someone understand that the loss of such a small thing makes everything else insignificant; How can I explain that I miss their presence, when I didn't even know they were with me in the first place?

I found out I wasn't carrying a viable pregnancy at my 12 week scan. (But the advice was wait for 2 weeks to confirm). 11 days later I miscarried, alot of blood and clots and I thought that was it (I actually felt surprisingly good physically and emotionally) but had to go for my scan 3 days later to confirm. I was told I had passed the majority but some pregnancy tissue remained. I decided to let nature take its course to try and avoid a minor operation and felt that I would be able to deal with everything if 

Later that night I was in agony, passed alot of clots. Knowing I was having contractions broke me and unfortunately I was on my own. The next morning I was still bleeding but felt everything was over.  2 days later my bleeding had stopped which was a relief after 2 weeks. A little early but took a pregnancy test 3 days after bleeding had stopped and it was negative. Great I thought I can deal with going back to work.

Emotionally I am broken but felt relief that I had some closure. Untill today. 3 days after a negative pregnancy test I have the most awful stomach cramps again. Is this normal? I don't believe I can be due to start a period already can I? I admit my partner and I have had sex, on the day I went for my first scan (before I was told not to) and once a couple of days after I had stopped bleeding but the day before my negative test . I  know your meant to wait but we needed to feel normal and really don't feel less 24 hours can make a difference? 

Has anyone experienced cramps so soon after bleeding had stopped.  Sorry for the waffle to ask.a simple question.",t3_ip1z8m
926,Miscarriage,"I remember telling my mom I was having a baby for the first time and her telling me she just had a dream I had a baby girl!  I let my superstitious side wander and thought I was going to have a little baby girl! Time goes on and that doesn't happen. Lost my baby back in June. 

Last night I met my baby in my dreams. I've never had a dream like that. It was me, my husband and brother hanging in the living room when a little girl runs in the room. At first I remember being confused that there's a little girl there. She goes straight for me and gives me a huge hug. It was my baby!  I was so confused in my dream because I remember thinking wait....didn't I loose her? And that thought lasted a second because I was so happy to be with my baby.  That's all. That's all I remembered when I woke up.

932,Miscarriage,"TW: sexual assault/1st MC

I don't know exactly what I'm doing/asking here. Just need to get this off my chest I guess. 

I conceived through rape and had an early miscarriage. I didn't talk about it at the time because I wasn't ready to share about the assault. Next month my baby would be turning 2 and still hardly anyone knows about it. I've gone through court and and am going through my second round of therapy. Several people know about the assault, but not MC. Now, I feel like it's been so long I don't know how to tell the people who I want to know about it and even feel uncomfortable talking to the handful who already know. (Note: most have given me hurtful responses - ""... I don't  have anything to say about that"" or ""it's a good thing it happened."") 
Anyway, I guess maybe this is the only way I feel able to share right now. I love(d) that baby more than myself and now it feels like I don't even have the freedom to talk about it in a healthy way. It also sucks because even if I just want to talk about my baby that I still love SO MUCH, the conversation is inevitably clouded by the assault. And I feel like the only blogs/vlogs/podcasts I hear are from the perspective of a husband and wife who were planning or at least somewhat prepared for a child. Some are kind of helpful, but not very relatable. Maybe I'm just feeling isolated idk

937,Miscarriage,"Today, an episode on Young Sheldon really triggered me today.. 

There is an episode in season 2/3 where Sheldon's mom  was pregnant. It didn't really bother me at first, as I could some what relate, she frustrated and lost about the new found pregnancy, where as the first couple weeks it was hard for me to become excited because of the fear of a miscarriage. I never miscarried before, but deep down in my gut I knew... It was when I had become excited and talking more about our future bundle of joy was when it all came to an end. 

I am not a religious person anymore (and honestly after the miscarriage, I will probably never be) and when Sheldon's mom went to talk to her priest about the pregnancy, he had said in some form or another, ""It's God's plan."" (Meaning the pregnancy). It really felt like a stab in the heart. I once believed that God only allowed children to be born, because they were meant to be someone. That no child was a mistake or accident because God had opened the womb. I was a kid, so it made me feel better about myself confidence. I started to cry thinking about how my new baby was never going to be .. I wiped away my tears and kept watching the episode. Then once the parents got all excited about baby, she had miscarried.

 I ended up leaving to find my husband at this point, as I couldn't stop crying. Sheldon's father had just found out about the miscarriage and had said something about how they had their first three kids, this one was just a charm. I couldn't watch it anymore and didn't rewatch the ending. 

Every day I think about how stressed , worried, disappointed I was for this first couple weeks after finding out (around 5-6 weeks along) and it makes me feel that it was all my fault. If I wasn't dreading about having a new baby, if I didn't worry or stress soo much, I'd still be pregnant. People are going to tell me it wasn't my fault, that it was not meant to be... I just will always feel that it was my fault, because I wasn't excited the very moment I found out. I feel so guilty and upset. It was so short lived (MC at 10 weeks) that I cry about how I could have been more excited, or happy, like I was with my first pregnancy. With covid and everything going on around the world right now, it was a very stressful time.. I'm always going to blame myself because even with knowing my current health situation, economic situation and everything else, I was the one who got pregnant in the first place. So I will always feel like this miscarriage was my fault.. even if science or all the tests tell me otherwise..

Thank you for reading, and even if nobody does, at least writing this all out has made me feel alittle better.

940,Miscarriage,"
My ex and i recently broke up after a couple of years of being together as the love wasnt there anymore on his side a couple of weeks ago.

Unfortunately last night i experienced an early miscarriage, I did not know I was pregnant and going by my cycle it could have been anywhere from 6-10 weeks. (my birth control makes me irregular)

My ex and I do not talk due to the sudden nature of the breakup but we share the same friend group who are very supportive of me and who I do plan on sharing this with as it is a painful process. 

I'm afraid that if I dont tell my ex what happened he will find out from one of our friends and be hurt, but if I reach out and tell him what happened I am fearful of looking like I am trying to manipulate him which is the last thing I want. It does hurt knowing that if this happened a month or two ago he would have been there for me rather than me sitting here on my own with no one except a hot water bottle.

Anyone have any views on the best way of handing it I know its a bit sensitive, should I ask to give him a call or let my friends know and he can find out on his own eventually.

942,Miscarriage,"My wife and I have been trying to get me pregnant for about a year, on and off. (Artificial insemination is expensive for us because our insurers don’t cover it for lesbians for the first six rounds, so we’d take breaks and save our pennies periodically.) I finally got a positive about three weeks ago and we were thrilled...and then tonight I began passing tissue and blood. I’m 90% sure this is the miscarriage I was afraid of. Tomorrow I’ll get confirmation from the doc.
I know it’s only my first MC and seeing people go through multiple here is so inspiring that I feel a little bad for saying this - but I don’t want to keep trying. This process has been emotionally exhausting and there have been some indications that my progesterone levels fluctuate randomly - docs don’t know why it happens, but for my part I strongly suspect I *can’t* carry to term. The next step is IVF and while I want a child more than anything in the world, I don’t want to do this. My wife is enthusiastic about carrying our child, so I think I’m going to let her. We’re lucky to have two uteruses available, but part of me feels guilty about backing off from any staring contest and that part would have me do IVF anyway just to see it through. Any advice?

945,Miscarriage,"I found out I was pregnant roughly five weeks ago after being admitted into the ER for abdominal pain, and after finding out that I was 6 days of being newly pregnant my HCG was 114, surprise! After a week or so my next HCG was 1041 and four days later from that  it dropped to 500 and then two days later an upward swing to 1051. All the while of having constant pain since I found out I was pregnant, a lot of cramping, loss of appetite all while having cravings. All of this happened within 5 weeks. Never saw anything on Ultrasound, just my numbers were up/down.  


Two days ago I felt the need to go into the emergency room and after a series of exams and ultrasounds, they told me I had an ectopic pregnancy. After being rushed to the OR they found that it wasn't just an ordinary ectopic pregnancy and that the fetal tissue went behind my uterus and implanted on my bowels. A full DNC scrapping, poking, prodding, removing a lot of blood from my belly... I'm home.  


I guess the one thing that hurts the most is that I feel like a failure. I feel my body let me down. I guess this is a normal feeling that some women experience, I'm usually pretty , happy, positive, healthy 29, yoga teacher and organic shopper, farm raised everything, country kinda gal. My heart hurts, my belly hurts and I never knew what this experience would do to the very core I've been trying to purely love the last few years. In all my years of working in medicine, I've never met anyone who needed this kinda of surgery or has gone through this... The struggle is, I feel alone and everyone around me, my support system is selfishly making this about themselves. I'm trying to create a space that is safe for me to heal but the body pain, the feeling of rejection and the feeling of failing. It's a lot.  


If anyone has any advice on how to cope when there is no real calm environment or support system, maybe no where to go. How do you keep present? Trying everything, meditation music, lavender, singing bowls, breathing, candles, just trying to create atmosphere in a toxic environment.

The tech couldn’t say anything, but I didn’t need her to. I had no symptoms for a few days, but they had all been pretty mild until then anyways, so it didn’t register as a big deal.

It goes without saying: I’m heartbroken. 

They scheduled my D&amp;C for Thursday. I just want to get it over with and get closure. Until I found out about the MMC, I had no spotting, cramping, anything. Yesterday at home I started cramping very lightly and intermittently. It’s coming in very gentle waves. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? On one hand, I’d rather have the D&amp;C and just be done with it, and on the other, I’d also rather not have the medical bills (fuck the US healthcare system) and be in the comfort of my home. 

Has anyone else had a D&amp;C scheduled and then miscarried naturally at home while waiting for it?

Long story short, I had about 2 hours of very heavy bleeding and passing clots. I passed about, what I would guess, would be several clots totaling in size to be around the size of my hand. And a ton of blood. Can anyone else who had a miscarriage at home, that was measuring around 6 weeks, chime in and let me know if this is definitely not enough to be done? The bleeding slowed WAY down and I have only passed a few tiny clots since then. I am getting an ultrasound either end of this week or beginning on next week to make sure everything is gone, but I am just curious. My nurse said that I would only pass some tissue and clots based on my ultrasound so I feel like that could have been everything.

6 weeks: started spotting brown 


6 weeks 1 day: starting spotting pink and red blood.


6 weeks 2 days: More red blood came out when I wiped in the bathroom. Went in for vaginal ultrasound and doctor could see the sac with the baby but said the baby was too tiny and I would miscarry. Didn’t check for heartbeat and said my HCG levels were too low for what they should be at that stage. Prepared me for losing the baby over the weekend.


6 weeks 3 days: very mild cramps, some clotting with tissue (dark and bright red). Only when I’m going to the bathroom though, it’s not filling up a toilet or my pad. It’s kind of sticky like I can pull it out.


6 weeks 4 days (today) : less clotting, minor cramping (scale of 1-2 out of 10 that come and goes), and more watery blood. Still not filling up a pad. It’s almost like it’s just sitting inside me until I go to the bathroom. 

I’m supposed to call the doctor in two days to check in with him after the holiday weekend.
Is this going to get worse with pain? Am I supposed to be bleeding a lot more? I’m wondering if the baby was so tiny that maybe it’s not going to be the amount of blood and cramping that I expected. 
I’m wondering though if my body isn’t letting go and I might need to get a D&amp;C. I would not want to go through this for weeks and weeks if possible.

958,Miscarriage,"I had a medically managed miscarriage on Thursday, after a missed miscarriage at 9 weeks (discovered at 10 weeks). I started having contraction-like cramping around four hours after administering the misoprostol (vaginal pessaries) and had fairly heavy bleeding for around two hours. It wasn't enough to fill a pad though and I didn't pass any large clots as expected, but I did pass some lining-like tissue. Since then I've had some steady bleeding, much like a period and a bit of cramping.

Based on the information I was given beforehand on what to expect, I really didn't have as much bleeding as I expected and the bulk of the bleeding/pain only lasted two hours, I had expected it to go on a lot longer. So now I'm worried that the misoprostol didn't fully work and I've had an incomplete miscarriage. I also still have pregnancy symptoms like nausea and tender breasts, which is just adding fuel to the flame of worry.

Obviously I'll be phoning my early pregnancy assessment unit (UK-based) tomorrow to ask them about it, but I wondered for those who have been through this, how much bleeding did you have?

959,Miscarriage,"My partner and I have been discussing starting a family at the start of next year. I had my IUD out in late May with the thought it would take some time for my cycle to get back on track. We were using protection in the meantime, while we tried to get at least a few things in order.
I had a positive pregnancy test (or 3) on Aug 17th - it was a huge surprise for both of us! It's been a terrible year (for everyone I know) and I naively hoped this might be a way to bring this year to a positive end. I have fibromyalgia and health anxiety - not a great combo for an unexpected pregnancy. But I've got a great doctor, was seen early, and kept on track.


I ended up in the ER 2 weeks ago with what everyone assumed was an ectopic pregnancy. I was devastated, but after 6 hours of waiting - alone, thanks covid - I thought I'd come to terms with it. Then Dr walks in and says UTI, pregnancy is right on track. I was so relieved - I hadn't realized - hadn't allowed myself to really acknowledge - just how much I wanted this baby until that moment.
I had my first official OB appointment this past Wednesday. Everything was going great until I gave a urine sample and there was blood. The Dr wasn't super concerned, but somehow I just knew. The US showed normal progression, so I was sent home with a follow up next week. Overnight I started bleeding heavily with strong cramps.
I went back to the Dr yesterday as they wanted to get ahead of the long weekend. Given the amount of blood and clots already passed I naively thought it was done. My partner and I had already given ourselves a night to grieve, named Baby A, and just felt the feelings (obviously not over, but it was a cathartic start towards closure). But the US showed that most everything was still in place - including the fetal sac. I knew there was no hope, but the moment that image flashed on the screen, I still felt it...hope. The Dr explained that the yolk sac had collapsed and that I had had an incomplete miscarriage. 


I took my first dose of misoprostol this morning, but 12 hours later, nothing's happened. I have another round for tomorrow, but I am so scared this won't work and I'll still have to go for a D&amp;C. I really can't afford the extra time off work - I know it's a ridiculous thing to worry about all things considered but f*Ck I just can't with this year.


I know it's all science and nothing I did. As soon as I found out I gave myself a crash course in the do's and don'ts. I was so determined to do my best... I'm just so f*cking angry with the Universe right now. Why? What purpose did this serve? I was trying - actively - to avoid this kind of thing this year. I stupidly hoped this was a sign the Universe was working back around to something positive then Nope!


I lost my mom in Sept 20 years ago this year. It's always a hard month, but during something like this where a girl just wants her mom, it's a particular knife in the heart. I know this sounds dramatic, but finding it incredibly difficult to keep any sort of faith right now. If life really is this random, what's the f*cking point?? I'm not suicidal by the way. I love my partner and our life; I know it'll all be OK. But right this moment the path forward just seems so bleak. I dread the pain and the blood and the whole gruesome process, but am also so, so ready to have this over so we can both move on and heal - physically and mentally.


This is a total rant, I know. If you've read this, I appreciate it. This sub has already helped me so much and my heart goes out to everyone. I was just so clueless and had no idea... My biggest grievance in this whole process has been the lack of education around the whole deal - I'm so sad and horrified at the lack of information that's given on the possibilities and the process itself. It's reassuring to know that there is a place women can come together and discuss this experience. I wish - much like mental health - that this could be a more open discussion in the everyday world.",t3_indpn0
960,Miscarriage,"I just had a d&amp;c after my first pregnancy ended in an MMC. I had just come off birth control and was not expecting to be pregnant so quickly. so before I tested positive at week 4 I had a few drinks that weekend and the weekend I would’ve been 3w. I also took 400mg of ibuprofen for a headache once and was drinking my normal two cups of coffee a day, until the test of course. How do I get over the guilt and the haunting feelings of causing my miscarriage with my behavior? My doctors keep reassuring me that I did not cause this but it’s hard to believe them.",t3_inb6yj
961,Miscarriage,"TW: Miscarriage, Other’s Living Child

My friend and I (best friends for 20+ years) were pregnant at the same time. I lost my baby and was supposed to be due this month. She gave birth almost 2 months ago. (I’ve had a few additional losses, but I haven’t shared that information with her. She only knows about 1 miscarriage, due to her insensitive comments/behavior.)

All throughout her pregnancy, she would confide in me about her pregnancy symptoms and pregnant life in general, complain, attention seek - meaning leaning on me to always say positive things to make her feel better, etc. All of our conversations were literally about her being pregnant. We were in her world, not once asking about me or my physical/mental state.

She made it a point to remind me constantly how 5 of her other friends were pregnant at the same time, and that it’ll be awesome to have the kids grow up together.

After my miscarriage, I told her verbatim that I was in a deep depression - so severe that my family wanted me to see a therapist to get better. I requested many times for her to refrain from speaking about her pregnancy (and complaining to me and coming to me to make her feel better and boost her up) and instead urged her to speak to her pregnant friends who would understand and could commiserate with her. This request was not respected, many times. Therefore, I distanced myself meaning I wouldn’t reach out other than to respond/congratulate her when her baby was finally born.

Examples - Complaining about pregnancy and symptoms *daily* (and all throughout the day), talking about how they are planning to have #2 right after (like I get it - it’s easy for you but not for all of us), reminding me how awesome it is that she’s pregnant at the same time as 5 of her friends and their kids will grow up together, she’s due X week and they’ll induce her if she’s not here by a certain day and complaining (at least you made it to the end - all of us aren’t lucky), texting me that her “goal is to keep the baby alive LOL” when months earlier I broke down when telling her about my miscarriage and said verbatim “why couldn’t I keep my baby alive?!” and going through the stages of grief like blaming myself.

Now her baby is almost 2 months old. She sent me a short line of text saying “miss you my friend.” I honestly don’t know how to respond. I mourned her and our friendship a long time ago, and kind of accept it for what it’s evolved to and just think it is what it is. Now she’s back saying she misses me out of the blue. I can’t go back into a friendship where it’s one-sided. I didn’t even get a phone call about the miscarriage. She doesn’t like making calls, which I told her I understand in text but I said I would like to speak to her over the phone about something serious - she knew it was about the miscarriage. I explained that it’s too casual in text. But we ended up just texting about it, not what I wanted. I think calls are appropriate for serious conversations or situations, but I was once again catering to her and her preferences - in a time where I needed support not her. She always declined my invites even before pregnancy, or would accept and then come up with an excuse later to cancel (mostly due to laziness). When it’s not even that much work or effort from her side because when we would meet, I would drive over to her to meet her - she wouldn’t come to my town or even meet in the middle (what I’d recommend so it’s 50/50 effort from both of us). I would see her in person maybe once a year when we live 45 minutes apart, but she chooses to text all day every day about stupid stuff and life. Honestly I would talk to my friends who live in different states over the phone and even make trips to see each other, not just having texting lives where she expects me to respond every day all throughout it the day. This just shows me that distance doesn’t make it more difficult to maintain friendships, so what is our excuse? I felt like I always made an effort, so I’ve just stopped completely now.

Now, why is it fair for her to come back and show interest all of a sudden? I don’t know how to respond at all. Does she just miss my attention and supportive nature?

She is a new mom. She doesn’t like serious talks, and I don’t want to cause her any stress or drama. I feel like it’s not even worth it to tell her the truth of how I feel let down and how our friendship has evolved into acquaintances, at least from my perspective. I think I should just give a gentle response about distance.

My husband, on the other hand, thinks that I’m being sensitive or jealous and said it’s not her fault I had a miscarriage and that she’s excited about her new life. I disagree and think she was repeatedly insensitive for disregarding my boundaries/request. However, my husband knew about my hurt feelings about the one-sidedness about a year prior to her getting pregnant. I literally cried for a month back then (before pregnancy), and it felt like a death. I felt like it was the end of our friendship then (probably not her though due to lack of self awareness), and then our pregnancies kind of brought us back together if that makes sense. I reminded him that she never respected my request after the miscarriage (aka not talking to me every day about her pregnancy), and he said she was probably overly excited to be a first time mom just like I was.

I understand that maybe she has avoided the topic of my infertility (or mental state) in an effort to avoid awkwardness on her part or to avoid making me feel sad, but when I literally say how severe my depression was (which is new and unlike my normal self in general) that my family and *other friends* were encouraging me to see a therapist, I didn’t eat for an entire week after my miscarriage and just cried all day/night and my husband forced me to eat something at that point so I wouldn’t just waste away and die, etc. - how can you ignore this and just talk about yourself in 100% of the texts that you initiate? There’s lack of self awareness, and then there’s selfishness. I think this is both. It’s not like a light switch and then the next time we text, I’ve healed from everything and moved on. Like how can you complain to me about your pregnancy symptoms *daily*, and then need a daily reminder to please stop and speak to your other 5 pregnant friends about the topic because I’m still traumatized and severely depressed?

Opinions wanted - how do you think I should respond? Being 100% honest, just PC short reply to keep it friendly but say I would like distance, or just be friendly and be nice to a new mom who probably needs support (aka my husband’s opinion)? I don’t even know how I should word anything, I’m bad at stuff like that... and it *needs* to be in texts because no calls. Ugh. Any examples of what I could say or how specially to word things?

962,Miscarriage,"I’m almost certain I miscarried Wednesday night at 9w+4d. I feel like I just need to get all my feelings out. This is my first pregnancy. 

Wednesday night (technically Thursday)12:30am until 9am, I had heavy, heavy bleeding and passed multiple large clots. I was supposed to have my first prenatal appointment Thursday morning. They sent me to get bloodwork Thursday instead of being seen in the office and then sent me for an ultrasound Friday afternoon at the hospital. 

At the hospital, they told me it looked like development stopped after week 5. They couldn’t see the fetal pole or any heartbeat. I prepared myself for that, but it still broke me. They handed me a miscarriage support packet and sent me home. 

Then my doctor called me an hour later and said she thinks my dates are off (I’m 99% sure they’re not). My hormone levels are still high, but they only have the one set of levels to look at. So she sent me for more bloodwork today to see if they’re going down. She thinks I might be 4 weeks pregnant instead of 9 weeks. I genuinely don’t think it’s possible. I had my positive test at the end of July and last period at the end of June. 

I feel like this is just false hope. With the amount of blood and clotting I passed, I don’t think there’s any way I didn’t miscarry. I don’t feel pregnant anymore. I feel like it sounds terrible, but I just want it to be over. I just want this chapter to end so I can move on and try to grieve. With the holiday weekend, it feels like it’s just being dragged out.. I understand my doctor needs to cover all the bases...but it’s just painful for me to be given some sort of hope when I rationally know there isn’t any.",t3_in8z2d
963,Miscarriage,I had a D&amp;C yesterday after two rounds of failed misoprostol for a MMC at 8.5 weeks.   And since my OB screwed around for too long I had a massive infection to boot so it was an emergency surgery.  I guess I also lost a lot of blood.  I can't hardly get out of bed.  I slept most of the day yesterday and today I can barely muster the energy to go change my pad.   My husband thinks I need to snap out of it but here it is nearly 4:00 and I can't will myself to do anything.   I don't care about anything or anyone really and just want to sleep.

965,Miscarriage,"
I just need a place to release the pain of what I am feeling. This is my second miscarriage this year and I’m dealing with it by forcing myself to be productive and not staring at the wall in shame and defeat. I didn’t even know I was pregnant and it was an early miscarriage, yet it still fills me with hopelessness. My last miscarriage was in February and I spiraled then into a pit of depression. I blamed myself even though I know it’s not my fault. It is what it is and my body decided I wasn’t ready to be a Mom. I know I’ll pull through and hit the surface eventually, but it’s an uphill battle. Luckily I have a good support system around me and I have people that help me when I need it. However, picking myself up and knowing that I will never hold what could have been is one of the hardest things I have to coupe with. I feel sad, angry, hopeless, barren, cheated, and grief for what could have been. It’s so many emotions to process but I hold onto the hope that someday I’ll be able to cuddle and laugh with a child of my own. I don’t know when I’ll be ready to try again or if I’ll be ready. I just want the pain to pass for right now.",t3_in7bso

My hopes have been at an all time high for four days now. I’ve been told if you don’t get a positive test by 16dpo, then you aren’t getting one at all.

970,Miscarriage,I found out I had miscarried 4w+6 in. No gestational sac found and 2 intra-vaginal u/s showed clear uterus/tubes. HCG went from 74-110-101 and tracking. No more cramping just some occasional discomfort. What concerns me is the bleeding. I went from spotting brown to heavy bleeding and passing some tissue. The last week I’ve transitioned from pads to liners but am still changing the liner 2-3 times/day. In the morning and during bathroom breaks I notice dark blood still dripping out into the toilet. Has bleeding continues this long for anyone else? Can it also be my period? No period like symptoms except fatigue and irritability the last 2-3 days. If it persists over the weekend I will be contacting mg MD on Monday. Any similar experiences or insights would be helpful!,t3_in9pp6
971,Miscarriage,"I was about 5 and a half weeks when the gestational sac stopped developing. Had a D&amp;C this week when I would have been 7 weeks along. Doctor wanted to make sure my HCG was decreasing appropriately so i had an HCG level done yesterday that’s &lt; 1. However, when I took a pregnancy test at home yesterday (was curious since i knew I’d have to wait for the blood results til today) it still came up pretty clearly positive. Has anyone experienced this? Maybe the bleeding/tissue that’s still coming out has some HCG that’s causing a positive in my urine but not the blood? I was also surprised to see a level of &lt;1 two days after a D&amp;C although my levels never got really high to begin with. They were around 1350 a week ago.

973,Miscarriage,"It just feels like every time something has the smallest chance to go wrong, it does. Bit of background, we started trying in December 2016. Since then, we've got pregnant 3 times on medication and miscarried each time (April 2018, Jan 2019 and August 2019). We've had all of the tests, and they were all negative. We were referred for IVF on the basis of infertility the day of lockdown (we're in the UK) and finally had the appointments last month. Next step was to wait for my period. Of course my periods are completely irregular so I didn't have a clue when that was going to happen. Every time I needed to start my period to do something (like a test) it was always a long cycle. Last cycle was 64 days so we were prepared for a long wait. 

Wednesday just gone, I started spotting (CD36). Thursday the spotting got more so I called the clinic and they booked me in for an appointment this morning. Thursday evening, there was A LOT of blood so I figured this was it. But yesterday, it tailed off and there was virtually nothing.

I went to the appointment this morning, and they did a scan. My lining was thick, not thin like it should be. Fine, I guess that wasn't my period so I'll just have to wait a couple of weeks. I'd had some spotting mid-cycle last cycle so hey, that's just how it is. She wanted to do a blood test to check I wasn't pregnant. Fine, whatever.

I phoned up for my results this afternoon, and low levels of hCG (31) have been detected. The consultant I spoke to said it might just be late ovulation, but all of my pregnancies have been behind. I need to go back on Monday for another blood test to see whether it's increased. I just feel like I'm waiting for a CP. And if my hCG doesn't get to 0 when my period starts, I'm out for this cycle.

It's made me wonder, how many of these have I had? I never usually test this early. Have I just been getting pregnant all this time and having repeat CPs? Has anyone been tested for anything similar, specifically low levels of hcG? 

Sorry for the long post. I'm just feeling pretty fed up and sorry for myself right now. We'd hoped this was the beginning of the end, but it looks like it's going to be an even longer road than we'd expected.",t3_in4t7q

! Possible Trigger Warning ! 

Hello. I am 13weeks as of tomorrow. One of my employees was due only a couple of weeks after me, we were so excited to go through our first pregnancies together. She found out last week her baby didn’t have a heartbeat. She said it’s called a “missed miscarriage” and she may have to have surgery. I want to do something for her. She’s a wonderful person. I am her boss (and am quite a few years younger than her, unsure if that makes a difference) and I want to help her as much as I can. I’ve already informed our big boss (corporate level) about her situation and I’ve taken her off the schedule for the foreseeable future. When she feels ready to come back I was thinking of having a discussion with her so she can set boundaries so that I don’t make her uncomfortable with talking about my pregnancy. She had been trying for 2 years and it only took me 6 months to get pregnant. I’m absolutely heartbroken for her and just what any advice to know how to properly approach her and be a helpful hand however she needs me.

Over the following days I would bleed heavily on and off with tissue. However, I had another ultrasound today and the gestational sac was still there but still no fetus or heartbeat.

987,Miscarriage,"Hello everyone! This is my first post, and I'm pretty desperate at the moment. Since 2019 I have suffered three miscarriages in a row (I have no children). The first was an MMC at around 9 weeks and I had to have a D&amp;C, which was extremely painful and traumatic. The second was a natural miscarriage between weeks 5 and 6, and the third happened around week 7 (we heard a heartbeat in the first and third pregnancy). 

I have been diagnosed with a bicornuate uterus, but all my doctors (I have seen at least six different ones) say that that couldn't have been the cause as a bicornuate uterus doesn't cause fist-trimester miscarriages. I have also been diagnosed with PCOS (even though all my hormone levels are normal) and trombophilia, as well as a mild form of hyperinsulinemia (my insulin levels become slightly elevated). I was on progesterone for my first pregnancy, and took daily clexane injections for my third, but this clearly didn't help. I have been advised now to take a number of different supplements (vitamin D, methyl-folate, aspirin...) and cut out all sugar, wheat and diary products from my diet and try again. Just thinking about getting pregnant again terrifies me, but giving up at this point is not an option. 

I have absolutely no difficulty getting pregnant. My thyroid is fine; we did a karyotype test, which came back normal; I had a pelvic MRI done; my blood work is good; and I am negative for the bacteria and viruses which have been found to cause miscarriage. 

As you can imagine, this has all been extremely stressful and painful, and there are days when I find it very hard just to get out of bed. This has affected my relationships with friends and family, and it is difficult to concentrate at work. Miscarriage is so terrible, but no one really talks about it and it feels so lonely. Luckily, I have an amazing, supportive husband, but it kills me that he has to go through all of this. 

Does anyone have any advice or has gone through something similar? Are there any other tests that I should take, or is there anything else I can do to increase the odds of the next pregnancy being successful? How do you generally cope with something like this? Any response will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",t3_imeez5

989,Miscarriage,"I’m so utterly disappointed in the care I got for my miscarriage.   I found out two weeks ago when at 8 weeks there was only a gestational sac in my uterus.  I was promptly pushed out of my room and had to sit in the waiting room crying while they scheduled an ultrasound.  When I get to the ultrasound, the ultrasound tech didn’t know my pregnancy wasn’t viable and kept asking questions about my pregnancy until I told her it was a miscarriage.
After that I didn’t hear from anyone for two days, then nothing again.   I got my ultrasound results back and no call.  I send a message to inquire about it and a nurse tells me that if I think I’m miscarrying to schedule an appointment.  This made me feel dismissed, but I kept on pressing and finally got ahold of my doctor to discuss the ultrasounds.  Everything’s fine, hcg dropping, miscarriage is progressing as it should.  
I thought I was done with it, but no.  Apparently despite having a confirmed miscarriage, no one had bothered to take pregnancy off my chart.   As a result, I get an email asking if I want to participate in a research study on gestational diabetes.  I was just getting to the point where I was making progress at moving on emotionally and now I’m pushed back into the sadness and grief I have been working so hard to overcome.  I’m just so mad.",t3_im3ssu
990,Miscarriage,"Hi all, I am currently still trying to cope with my most recent miscarriage (found out I was pregnant in may, lost it in June). This is my third miscarriage in 7 years. My first was a blighted ovum and the last 2, there was no longer a heart beat once I reached 8 weeks. I’m just beyond devastated and having the hardest time ever. Any advice and kinds words would be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",t3_im48zm
991,Miscarriage,"Hi all,

I keep thinking about this and that’s why I’m posting on an alt account. For some background knowledge:

When I was 21 I went through a break up with my high school sweetheart and met someone new. He was military and I was in the middle of switching birth control, ended up pregnant. We got married and I lost my baby at 18 weeks. We stayed married for a total of 3 years but are better off just friends. 

Since then I’ve always had issues with sex. I really don’t think I want kids anymore due to the pain being so hard to go through. I’m a high risk pregnancy due to being type one diabetic and don’t think I could deal again. I’m 27 and very happy with my current relationship. 

My high school sweetheart and I are back together after growing up with the time apart. 
We’ve been back together for 3 years and it’s been wonderful. Everything is great, minus my issues with intimacy. Does it every get easier? I wasn’t very sexual before but it has been tough. It’s been 5 years... and things feel like they’ll never be the same. 

I’m am grateful to have an understanding partner but it’s still tough.",t3_im5kux
992,Miscarriage,"Hi, I am just feeling all the things right now and have no idea what to expect in the coming days? Weeks? I am experiencing my first ever miscarriage. I guess it's technically a chemical pregnancy. I am between 4 and 5 weeks but I don't know exactly. I got my first positive on Sunday and noticed the lines were getting lighter and lighter on the tests. Finally called my OB yesterday and did some labs and they confirmed that I was pregnant and that my progesterone levels indicated it would end with a miscarriage. I wasn't given anymore information. I have to go back and retest HCG to make sure the levels are coming down but I have no other information. I guess I am just wondering what your experience was? How long did you test positive for? When did you start to bleed and what was your experience with that? I am actively trying to conceive so I'm not sure when I can start again and that is so frustrating to me. Any thing helps. Thankfully I'm mentally in good spirits. Just anxious about what's to come...",t3_im6fz0

It wasn’t the first urine of the morning so I understand it’s not necessarily bad, but I talked to my dr today and she didn’t exactly ease my mind. I feel like I’m starting to cramp a little and am really scared. Going in for my first blood work tomorrow and then again Tuesday cuz it’s the fucking long weekend. So I won’t have any hope of peace of mind until then.",t3_im8bbg
994,Miscarriage,"I just got my D&amp;C done this morning, and wanted to give back to this subreddit and describe my experience in case it helps anyone. Being here has really helped me through the grieving process and helped me decide what action to take. I really appreciated all the great responses I got.

I was diagnosed with a blighted ovum on August 25 at 7 weeks 2 days. I went back in this last Tuesday, September 2, and opted for the D&amp;C. I was given the choice of a D&amp;C with local anesthesia or with general. I was told I would be able to schedule the local D&amp;C faster than the general. I am a little wary of general anesthesia because of its risks, and though I knew it would be more comfortable, I decided local was the way to go - plus I wanted to just get it done. I managed to get in two days after my follow-up appointment, which was great.

I did not see my OB, but another one who performs these D&amp;Cs regularly. My health system is a big HMO (Kaiser) and that's how it works. My husband drove me to the medical offices and dropped me off. He was able to wait at some outdoor tables, but couldn't come in because of COVID. I went in, checked in and only waited a minute or two before they brought me to the back. The MA did her stuff, I had to take my pants off and put a plastic sheet over my lap, then a nurse came in to give me a shot of Toradol. It's an anti-inflammatory that is administered in the hip/glute to help with cramps. It wasn't painful and was easy to deal with - I'm used to shots and blood draws, though, thanks to being hypothyroid.

The doctor came in and ran me through the whole procedure. He mentioned I would have some cramping but that the whole thing would only be 2-3 minutes. Then they set me up on the table and did an abdominal ultrasound, where they saw the sac (still as empty as ever) and started the procedure. The speculum going in wasn't that bad, and felt like a pap smear. Then he said dilating the cervix would cause some cramps, which it did. Very mild, though. I couldn't even feel the numbing agent go on it. 

The most uncomfortable part by far was the vacuum/aspiration itself. It caused a worse cramp, though I would say more in line with a period cramp. I don't really have period cramps, but those of you who do would be able to deal with it better than me, I'm sure. I just took a few deep breaths. He took the vacuum out once, put it back in to get the rest and then...I was done. The vacuum part maybe lasted 15-20 seconds in total.

My OB kept asking how I was doing and told me he could go slower or stop if I needed it. I very much appreciated those options. I just wanted it done so I figured I would power through it, but it showed compassion for him to say that. In a big medical system like Kaiser, not all doctors are equal and I felt cared for (and cared about) by both these OBs.

I put on a pad and waited in another office for a few minutes and drank some water. Then he came in and gave me aftercare instructions. I went downstairs to the pharmacy to get a dose of azithromycin, which I took after lunch (to prevent infection) and naproxen (basic NSAID). I had some mild cramping throughout. 

Now it's the afternoon and the cramping comes and goes. But it's really mild so far. My bleeding is light, more than spotting but not even a medium flow yet. My actual OB told me to wait at least 2 cycles to try again, and this OB said I didn't have to, but they recommend it for mental health/psychological reasons. He did say it might take a while to get observable cervical mucus back, something I hadn't heard about before, so I will have to do some research into that. I rely on cervical mucus a lot to tell when I am ovulating. Anyway, I am letting my body and my psyche dictate when I am ready again.

Now I will try some raspberry leaf tea, which supposedly helps with periods and may help with post-miscarriage recovery. I love tea, so if it doesn't work, I will still enjoy it!",t3_im38uj
995,Miscarriage,"I had a miscarriage/PUL back in November. I had slow rising hcg which eventually dropped by itself and I naturally miscarried. Since my numbers were so low (never over 150) they weren’t able to see anything on the ultrasound except for a small mass on my ovary which they said could’ve also been a cyst. I should be 7 weeks pregnant tomorrow but started some light spotting on Monday. My hcg was 372 and has only risen to 452 in 48 hours and my symptoms seem to come and go as my hcg rises/drops. I’ve accepted that this isn’t a viable pregnancy but am wondering if anyone had slow rising hcg that was not an ectopic. My last experience was awful with repeated bloodwork for 5 weeks, a number of emergency ultrasounds and bleeding for about 8 weeks. I’m just worried I got “lucky” the first time avoiding surgery or methotrexate and am hoping I can avoid the stress of repeated testing, fear of rupturing, etc. I have an ultrasound tomorrow and I’m just wondering if anyone has had slow rising or up and down hcg levels that confirmed it was an intrauterine pregnancy vs. PUL?",t3_im7gch
996,Miscarriage,"Hi there, I can't imagine what it must feel like, but I wish no one had to feel this terrible pain. I am glad this subreddit exists, at least, where people can vent, grieve, and be supported by an online community.

My friend just miscarried and our group of friends have made a schedule of who will cook dinner for them and drop it off each night for the next two weeks. But we so badly want to do more for them. Is there anything else we can do or give to show them love and support? We obviously want to give them space and don't want to overwhelm them, but if you have any ideas for how we can show them love, I'm all ears. I saw another thread about someone living out of state and wanting to help their friend, and that thread mentioned sending them a card, or coloring book, or a small gift like chocolates. At least our group of friends all live within 25 minutes of one another, so perhaps there are more in-person things we can do. 

Thank you for any ideas you might have.",t3_im0qgx
997,Miscarriage,"I had a miscarriage 3 months ago. We have been remote/online teaching but today went back to school to get ready for our children back on Monday. I am truly excited to be back in a classroom and was so looking forward to today. 

Another teacher announced her pregnancy and I felt like I had been hit by a bus. I barely held it together till the end of the day. I congratulated her and was ok with my fake smiles. 

The heartbreak feels relentless. This endless cycle of grief with no closure is just wearing me down and now I am listening to joyous conversations that I’m not ready to listen to. 

I know that this is a totally selfish ‘it was supposed to be me’ reaction and I feel the guilt of that too. But how am I supposed to watch her go through this everyday?

999,Miscarriage,"I went to the ER last Friday night for spotting. They took a cervical and vaginal ultrasound. After I got up from the ultrasound - I noticed a lot of mucus - pink with white round bubbles. I was pretty shocked. I thought something was wrong with my 6 week pregnancy but was not expecting that at all. 

They said they saw a gestational sac in my uterus but no yolk sac or fetal pole. The sac was aged at 5+1 when I should have been 6+3. I went home and had major cramping and laid in bed all Saturday and Sunday morning I passed something - what I think was placenta. That’s the only thing that has came out of me besides blood for the past week. 

My HCG went from 1400 this Monday to 160 yesterday. What should I expect going forward? The blood seems to be tapering off as I’ve only been spotting today. From everything I’ve read - a lot more usually comes out when you have a miscarriage at 5 weeks. Is it possible the vaginal ultrasound I had in the ER sped along the miscarriage? 

Finding out today that my HCG level was only 160 yesterday was the only thing that really makes all of this real. I was hoping that little bean was still in there. Regardless of what the science says, I will never get another vaginal ultrasound again.",t3_im1lla

1004,Miscarriage,"Long vent warning. 
Had a MMC at 9 weeks and D&amp;C 2 weeks ago. The timing of this particularly sucks because we really wanted to have our first baby before we moved across the country at the end of June for my new job. We were trying for 5 months, this was my first pregnancy. I was really hoping, even though logically I knew it wouldn’t happen, that maybe the doctor would say it’s ok to start trying again immediately (like today) because we have maybe 2-3 more weeks in which I could still get pregnant in our planned window. 
When I asked she looked concerned and said absolutely not, need to wait at least 2 cycles. And it just broke me. Holding on to that little hope of trying again now was keeping me sane, even if the chances of actually getting pregnant were low. Now we have to wait about 6-7 months to start trying again mostly because of my job. 
To make it worse, she then proceeded to explain and draw the entire process of how fertilization and pregnancy happen as well as timing of ovulation and cycles after just having the discussion that we can’t try again for awhile. I fully appreciate that you have to treat all patients the same but I am also a doctor and this was a very planned pregnancy tracking ovulation, etc. so it just frustrated me. (Side note: I want to point out that I absolutely do not expect or want to be treated differently than other patients and never bring up the fact that I am a doctor unless specifically asked, it was just frustrating in this particular moment). 
When I explained in more detail that I was upset because we couldn’t try again for many months she said some things like “well you are only 31 don’t worry” and “at least you have the new job and the move to distract you.”

No. It’s not a distraction. In fact I’m feeling pretty resentful of my entire career right now. When all you want is to have a baby your age and how much time you theoretically have don’t matter. We have already been putting it on hold for a few years because of my job then when we were finally ready this happens and we’re put on hold again. It sucks. 

Thank god this was just the surgeon that did my d&amp;c and not my regular OB. Maybe I’m being too harsh and I was already upset so I’m being dramatic about her statements, I know she was just trying to be positive. I just feel that someone who treats patients going through this on regular basis should know that being empathetic and acknowledging their pain is far more comforting than trying to put a positive spin on it. 

Anyway, trying to pull it together and not cry until I get home so I can get through seeing my own patients today. Thanks for listening.",t3_ilvah9
1005,Miscarriage,"I miscarried back in May. It's been months, and while the frequency of breakdowns I've had has decreased, the intensity of them when I do have them has increased. And it's almost never anything baby-related that triggers it, which is the worst part. It's been work-related stress or some annoying thing that set me off and immediately my mind flips to my own feelings of inadequacy from miscarrying.

I know it's not my fault. I did the genetic testing. I know I had an unlucky genetic mishap. I work in a scientific field so I get the specifics of how this happens. But.....fuck being rational about this. There is not a day that goes by where I don't think I was at fault for the loss of our son. Every subsequent period since, all I think about is how I missed another chance. And both of those thoughts are ridiculous, I know, but I can't dig my way out of it. I go to therapy, and that helps, but I can't imagine calling my therapist at 1am. I was independent before this, and it irks me to feel so helpless now.

He told me everything is fine and to take a home pregnancy test in a week and he believes I should be at zero by then. And good to go try again.

Then it would have been official to everyone else. The photo announcement I’ve wanted to make, that I’ve had posted on my Pinterest board for years now, I’ll finally get to post it. 

But now, I’ll probably go to the party and constantly hold a glass of wine in my hand because I don’t know if I’ll survive the “are you pregnant question” or worse “why aren’t you pregnant yet?” This might be the weekend that I finally snap. I feel myself slipping back into the funk. I hope I’m just being emotional and we get lucky this cycle.

Whilst trying to ""protect"" my brain from having to look at baby posts on Instagram I started unfollowing some accounts (brands, parenting associations etc) and came across a friend who's recently had a baby. My finger hovered over the ""unfollow"" button and then it struck me: I don't want to have to pretend they don't exist so I can feel ok.

This friend in particular has had a horrendous journey having a family, and I realised that I am actually over the moon for her and her husband. Seeing pictures of their baby made me think ""they made it! A little baby made it through all this impossible stuff and now they're here and that's incredible"".

So now when I see a baby online or on TV or in the street, rather than it making my heart sink it actually makes me feel good. Not happy, and not hopeful, but I feel like my team is winning because they made it.

TW: missed miscarriage

I started light spotting a week ago on Thurs at 10+5. On Sun I had some cramping so went in for an US on Mon at 11+1. There’s a sac measuring nearly 11wks but not much else...maybe a 6wk embryo. I haven’t been given much info except I need another scan next Mon unless I miscarry before then. Is this considered a missed miscarriage? A blighted ovum? Both?

I’ve been having gradually increasing cramping (usually in the evenings) and some brown blood, but not enough to fill a pantyliner. WTF? How will I know if everything has passed? Will I definitely get heavy bleeding at some point? I plan on asking for misoprostol or similar next week. 
I know each experience is different, I just haven’t heard of many women who had really light bleeding for a long time before miscarrying. Just wondering what to expect. We are hoping to try again as soon as I’m physically able so just want this over now. ☹️",t3_ilph3w

1017,Miscarriage,"Whats it like to lose your baby before she's viable. First you go up to labor and delivery. You sit there in labor except you know it won't be a happy moment in a few hours. You have tons of doctors come in to see what the plan is, so they decide to do a amniocentesis. They cannot perform it because there's barely any fluid left and thats when the doctor grabs your hand and tells you we can't save your baby. The nurse puts a ""catcher"" in the toilet, you know just incase. You're so sick you can't get the epidural so they load you with other drugs to help with the pain. Right before you push they warn you your baby may not survive delivery because she is so fragile. But she does. You find features if she looks like mom or dad more. The nurse keeps checking for a heart beat every so often. Then after an hour she checks again, and at that moment you're even more crushed. The doctor comes in with soap and water so we can give our daughter her first bath. Our parents come and say goodbye to our daughter. The nurse gives you a cooling pad to place your deceased daughter on so you can spend every last second with her. Then the next day, you get sent home with nothing but a box of memories.

- My co-worker just announced she is pregnant and sent a picture of the ultrasound. Her baby is also due on what my due date was (but next year), and the ultrasound picture was exactly what my baby should have looked like on the day that I miscarried.
- My husband doesn’t remember what day it is and it just makes me feel more alone like this was MY struggle and nobody is here to support me or understand.

1019,Miscarriage,"Hi Everyone! Looking for some advice and possibly some clarity.. 

I had a miscarriage at 8.5 weeks and have a D&amp;C. 2 weeks later I was feeling a lot of pressure and pain so I went back to see my doctor and there was a bunch of tissue back in my uterus. They checked my HCG levels and I was at 1700 so they suggested they do a second D&amp;C to remove the remaining tissue.   They sent my tissue to the pathologist to make sure it wasn’t a molar pregnancy and I was told my results were benign.   

I am now 11 days post my second D&amp;C and I went back to the doctor today with pressure and pain in my right groin. Today’s ultrasound showed my uterus full again with tissue and a 6cm cyst on my right ovary.

1021,Miscarriage,"Does anyone else feel this way? Is it normal? Informed I was no longer pregnant on July 31st, fuck I wish I could just forget that whole date, and I was pretty devasted. Was definitely not planned, got pregnant on Depo, am super young (twenties), never thought I wanted kids..but the minute they said I was pregnant, and the test lines showed up positive, I was in love and it was very much a wanted pregnancy even if unplanned. And when they told me I was no longer pregnant they had the fucking nerve to say ""you must be so relieved 🙂 and you can always try again in a few years when you're older"". Like wtf, who says that to someone?!?! Especially when they asked how I felt about it and I told them it was very wanted and I was only concerned for their health as I had started bleeding two days earlier, which on the phone when I called them they said it was ""no big deal, nothing to worry about"". I cried for weeks after, when I was driving home I'd have to pull over and compose myself so my boyfriend wouldn't see, or I'd get out of bed in the middle of the night and sob in the bathroom trying not to wake him up. I've always been a private, pessimistic person, so being so happy and optimistic about the future and the baby was a complete 180 for me. And when I lost it I felt like a fucking idiot for buying into the dream. And I couldn't stand for others to see my cry or feel anyway towards it. I had a name, I had nursery themes, I had a game plan, because even if this kid completely threw my life for a loop I knew I'd do anything for them. I miscarried extremely early, only about 8 weeks, never had pictures, never even got an exact due date, just a ""yep, you're pregnant"" and was told to just keep my appointment for a different issue (July 31st) and they'd check everything real quick. Now I'm just...numb. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to go to work. I don't want to clean my house. I don't want to sleep. I don't want to be awake. The only thing that makes me feel better is being by my dog and my boyfriend, and he's hours away for work and I only get him for 2 nights and 1 day when he's off, if I'm lucky. I've been seeing one of those free online psychiatrists as I can't get into a real one right now because if this stupid fucking virus, but I don't know how much it's helping. When I first lost it, I DESPERATELY wanted another right away. But now I wonder if that's what's best, we're so young, we're not completely stable,we don't own a home,I haven't finished school. And at this point I don't even know if being pregnant again will get me out of this weird depressed phase. I just want to know if anyone else has gone through this feeling? This emptiness? Does it get better naturally? Should I try to fight to see a psychiatrist immediately for antidepressants? No doubt I'm depressed but I don't even know if those will help at this point. No suicidal thoughts or anything like that, but I just don't know what to do. Just any helpful things that anyone who's had this same feeling can share, or how they got out of it, or just that I'm not completely losing my goddamn mind.",t3_ikzjsl

Now I have to drive over an hour away to another ER to have a shot of methotrexate administered. None of our local hospitals administer it.

1023,Miscarriage,"Hello I’m really confused with what’s been happening so last week on Tuesday my partner went into hospital as she was having like contraction like pains so she went in they checked if she was dialated and she wasn’t they also did a internal ultrasound whilst she was there again no heartbeat and they described to her that the baby was in 3 separate parts inside of her that’s what the scan showed anyone know why this would happen ? She’s still bleeding and getting lower abdominal pain she’s also been getting servere back pain too I don’t know what that could be down too what’s the strange thing is yesterday she said she felt movement and kicking inside of her which I refuse to believe as this is almost impossible she said if she put her hand on she could feel it which is literally impossible on the first ultrasound there was a weak heartbeat 2nd there was no heartbeat 3rd there was no heartbeat and they described the baby to be in 3 separate parts they have also said they are sending her a letter for her induction soon , they have also done testing on part of tissue which she passed and that showed that the baby passed at 14/15 weeks and blood test showed hcg had decreased rapidly I just really can’t get my head around it really could that movement she was feeling be phantom movements as they call it ? As it’s that ultrasound they did that’s got me thinking it’s literally impossible where they said that he’s in 3 separate parts .",t3_ikubb2
1024,Miscarriage,"I lost my first pregnancy last Monday at 8 weeks because there was no heartbeat at our first ultrasound. I was and still am devastated. I took Misoprostol that day and felt like I passed everything, it was brutal. I had another ultrasound yesterday and there is still tissue left in my uterus. I just took my second dose, I have cramps but no blood. I’m not sure I can mentally or physically handle this again. Does the 2nd dose usually do it?",t3_ikx458
1025,Miscarriage,"First time poster here, sorry for typos and formatting errors as I post from a mobile and am not a native english speaker.

So this january my period was late. On the 7th day I decided to do a test. It showed the faintest of lines but it had some colour to it. Did 2 more the next day, one showed an evaporation (colourless) line. The other one I couldn't understand, the line was and wasn't there, the nerves probably played tricks on me. That evening I started spotting and went hurrah! crisis averted!.
Next day no period though except the tiniest amount when going to the bathroom. My periods have been very consistent and second day is always the heaviest. Food for thought. Went to dr the next day, they seemed very impersonal and kind of in a hurry, went to lie down, put my feet up in the stirrups for the ultrasound...and wooosh comes the blood. Felt very silly and stupid and overreacting. They took my blood, after a few days I called and got a fast ""not pregnant"" after which they ended the call.
Last week I visited my gyno for the first time after some years for a checkup, they looked up my records as soon as I sat down and confirmed that I indeed had a very early miscarriage. Went over it in her wonderful cheery nonchalant matter, telling me these things happen and it is very common etc. Love her. But for me...I thought I was never pregnant in the first place during all these months. I wanted to argue but she is literally the best gyno in my country, only one who does reassignement surgeries too and you have to wait 4+ months to see her (average wait time for a gyno is about a month or less). She knows her stuff.

But it all makes me so confused. I feel no loss really as I hoped for the initial tests to be negative anyway but there is also this weird emptiness I guess? I just thought about it and realized the due date would be very soon now and that thought in itself made me feel weird as I don't know if I was even allowed to think like that as the pregnancy barely even existed and I didn't want it in the first place? Has anyone been in this position before and maybe has some advice?",t3_ikwy2q

1031,Miscarriage,"Hello everyone,

I am 22 years old and I recently went through a miscarriage of an unwanted pregnancy. I was physically, mentally, and emotionally alone through it because of the current pandemic. I study in another country and so I kept this to mostly myself so as to not stress out my parents who would be worried about my physical and mental health especially since travelling home is not an option right now. Moreover, the ""Sperm Contributor"" was someone I was in a casual relationship with and had the emotional and mental capacity of a brick.

For two weeks I spent all my time crying, feeling guilty, powerless and I could barely leave my bed. In a time when I should have focussed on my health more, I ended up neglecting it further. Even though I was physically fine(medically speaking) I was not mentally (probably still not completely) doing okay. As a Computer Engineer student, I turned to look out for Mental Health Apps. I tried the common ones such as Calm, Happify, etc but most of these were meditation apps and nothing was focussed on women's mental health. Apps like Flo (which I have been using for almost a year now) and Clue are great for tracking periods, ovulation, etc but don't necessarily provide any support or help for women experiencing miscarriages or abortions. This is shocking especially since the mental health app market is expected to be a $214 billion USD market by 2025 and 20% of women who experience miscarriages suffer from some form of PTSD and/or mild to moderate depression.

I was wondering if other people in this community have any opinions on the lack of Mental Health apps or tech-focussed on women experiencing miscarriages or abortions? If this is too broad here are a few questions you can use as a guideline:

1. Would you consider downloading an app to track your health, symptoms and find a community to help through a miscarriage/abortion? If not, why not?
2. What features would you expect from such an app?
3. What are the biggest mental and emotional health issues you faced?

Thank you for reading this and responding to this if you do! I hope all of you are healthy mentally, emotionally and physically and if not, are on your journey to becoming healthy. All my love and good wishes to you lovelies&lt;3",t3_ik54yz
1032,Miscarriage,"My sister recently told me how she wishes she could understand what I was going through, so she could help me feel better. I told her that I would never want her to understand what I'm going through. I wouldn't want anyone to understand. Being there for someone doesn't mean you have to understand or relate to their loss.. being there for someone means that they know you're there when they need you the most.. 

 My point is, you don't need to understand what they are going through to be there for someone. It's okay if you don't know what to say.. don't be afraid to say that either.

Beyond struggling to cope with the sinking reality that I will never carry to term (per diagnosis of now five different clinicians) and literally everything else going on in the world, no one besides my partner has even once reached out to check in on how we’re doing. Not friends, not family. I’m (in a morbidly fortunate twist of fate) the only one in my circle to have miscarried. And while I certainly could reevaluate my choices in friends, how do I deal with the fact that even my own mom has yet to ask how I’m doing?",t3_ijrq9h
1035,Miscarriage,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask this (aside from, yes going to a doctor)

Anyhow, my period was late which is unusual for me, I immediately remembered a very “wild” birthday weekend with my fiancé  a couple of weeks prior... so I took a pregnancy test and there was a really faint line but it was a test I had sitting underneath the bathroom sink (I keep a bunch of stuff in my medicine box) I was feeling very dizzy and nauseous for a couple of days and called it pms. 
Anyways the day after I took the test I started spotting. Just a little. Maybe enough to fill a liner for the day. 
Today I woke up with heavier bleeding, I’m like great! This is my period, but since morning I’ve been getting sharp pains in my pelvis area and horrible back pain, I constantly have to sit or just get on my hands and knees and ride out the pain. I’m trying to figure out if this is a really shitty period or if I’m having a mc. I’ve never had pain like this for periods but I did for a miscarriage I had a few years ago(at 9w3d if I was pregnant rn I’d be about 4w 2d) But the difference is I remember clots, they scarred me. This bleeding however has very minimal small clots. Nothing bigger than a pea. I’m seeing my doctor tomorrow as the ER isn’t an option with all the covid stuff going on. But any thoughts?

1038,Miscarriage,"Married almost 7 years, children weren’t in the cards yet 4 months ago we got pregnant. Took a while to warm up to the idea but then it became so very real. I’m a planner, we planned so much in our daily talks, names for each gender and surprised close family and friends (we are a household with tons of animals).

First ultrasound they said there’s the heart, it’s in the right place but you’re timing may be off so let’s reschedule next week. Few hours later my doctor called with worst case scenario news to prepare for but we stayed positive. Second ultrasound was so quiet, they tech said she’d have the dr come in and I had a bad feeling. Baby stopped growing at 6 weeks and no heart beat, I had no symptoms of MC and still felt very pregnant. 

It’s been a month of crying, isolation from those that knew, insomnia and pain. Couldn’t bare passing it naturally and sad to say it took 3 doses of Misoprostol followed by an ultrasound to confirm it worked (had very sharp pain and cramping likely from all the doses). Also discovered I have a pulp which may have existed before baby. They say no one knows what caused it but I’m getting a sample taken out of the polyp shortly to be safe. 

Started taking to a family friend that’s been through a few MC’s and she suggested a forum like this to help let things out. We’ve also started with a social worker once a week, it’s a start but I’m very anxious and sad almost every day. Had to take some time off work because it’s too much not sleeping, being so sad and trying to put on a brave face.

We’re hoping to try again when the healing happens however every day feels like a roller coaster still.

Today my best friend who is very pro choice was taking about how it’s not really a baby when you’re pregnant, but a fetus. I like to say that I’m pro life for myself, but pro choice for everyone else. Meaning I don’t think abortion is right, but I realize that there are millions of different circumstances that can happen and no one sets out to have an abortion as a life goal. Anyways, listening to someone so close to me announce that it is only a fetus made me really think about my pregnancies again. I got upset and was literally shaking and started to wonder what I had actually been pregnant with. I felt so close to the babies I could feel growing inside of me that the thought of them not being actual people really made me panic. That maybe I had been shellfish for mourning the loss of two people when according to my friend they weren’t even actually real.  I don’t even know what kind of advice I’m looking for here.

He passed very unexpectedly exactly 4 weeks and 1 day later from an aneurysm. 3 weeks after he passed, she went to her doctor because she wasn’t feeling well. She was nauseous, tired, cramping, digestive problems, and a number of other issues that she attributed to grief and was hoping to talk with the doctor about anti-depressants, which her counselor had recommended. Upon learning Kate had gone off her birth control (they were planning on getting married within 6 months and were getting ready to start trying for a kid) the doctor said first she wanted to check if Kate was pregnant. Kate thought she was crazy, she’d only been off the pill for 8 weeks when her fiancé passed and they’d been using protection. Turns out doc was right, Kate was pregnant. She was excited but sad/scared to be doing it alone, she said it was comforting to think she’d still have a little piece of him with her in the kid but hadn’t really wanted to do it alone. A week later she went to her OBGYN and they did further testing and determined my sister was 8 weeks along, meaning she was 4 weeks pregnant when time her fiancé passed. 2 weeks later she started to feel very sick and had some spotting. Our mom had a miscarriage in between Kate and I. She told Kate to get in to the OB ASAP. She got an emergency visit with her OB and it turns out she was miscarrying.

I’m having an unassisted miscarriage (first pregnancy, anembryonic, gestational sac stopped growing at 6mm, confirmed loss at 7w4d). After 9 days of brown spotting, the bleeding finally began last Monday (when I would have been 8w). For 3 days, I had the worst cramps ever (and I was almost hospitalized because of cramps as a teen), but the bleeding, while bright red, constant, and with clots, was not heavy at all.

Thursday the cramps stopped. But since yesterday I’m having this strange abdominal pain, it’s as if my pelvic muscles are sore. It hurts af when going to the toilet (either bladder or bowel movements), I can’t even stand upright. Dragging my feet because can’t walk normally.

I read some stories about women having muscle soreness after D&amp;C, but my miscarriage started on its own. (I’m still bleeding with clots, but midly).

Since I don’t feel anything else (fever, dizziness, clammy skin, nausea etc), I’m avoiding going to the hospital for now (without covid I would have gone yesterday...) The pain increases and decreases, but it’s always there. 

Did anyone experience anything similar? I asked my SIL but she only had cramps when she miscarried.

1057,Miscarriage,"Throwaway account as my partner uses reddit. We (me 29m, Partner 29F) had a mc at 10 weeks, just over a month ago. my partner already has a child from a previous relationship so naturally I felt like it had to be my fault, right? The first few days were the hardest, but we got through and it seemed like things were looking up. 

We both went back to work (we had been off on furlough anyway and were due back a couple of weeks after it happened) and I thought things were improving. But the last week or so it's been really tough for her again. She had her first period and that seemed to kickstart it, I knew it would upset her so I just tried to support her and i sort of channelled everything into that to keep out of my own thoughts (I sometimes have a little cry still when she's not home but I don't want to upset her more by crying around her) I thought I was doing fine, until I was tidying up and I found a screwed up piece of paper next to the bin. 

I didn't really think much of it so i opened it up, expecting it to be just some random info or something, but it was, I dunno, it seemed almost like something you'd write in a diary. But it was dark, it was stuff like how she blames herself, and she's scared that I will stop loving her over it. The last line still haunts me, it said ""I wish I had my baby"" and when I read it I just sat down and ugly cried for about 10 minutes. I got rid of the note and carried on, but it killed me a little inside to know that it's tearing her up like this. We haven't discussed what happened with anybody apart from a few of her close friends so I had nobody to talk to about things except her, but I don't want to upset her more by bringing it up, so I had to write it down somewhere to try and process it.

I guess I'm just worried that she might need more help than i can give her, but I wouldn't even know how to bring it up. This isn't even a question really I just had to let it out.",t3_iiq30n
1058,Miscarriage,I had a miscarriage in March of 2019. I didn’t even know at the time that I was pregnant until after it happened. It was very early on but incredibly painful. I’m still dealing with the trauma of it. But a lot of people have been telling me that I shouldn’t be traumatized because it was an unwanted pregnancy and I mentioned I would’ve considered terminating. But it still feels like the choice in the matter was ripped away from me. I’m just getting tired of feeling like what happened to me isn’t bad enough to be supported.,t3_iiq6cf

1060,Miscarriage,"My wife and I lost our baby one week ago today.  She was 8 weeks along.

1061,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone.

I believe I miscarried Wednesday. My OB only ordered blood work, but the cramps and bleeding got so bad that I went to the ER. I had an ultrasound and they said while they couldn't confirm it, they suspected miscarriage.

I had more blood work done today and was supposed to receive a call with the results. My doctor never called (that's a whole other story) and now I have to wait until Monday. So of course I'm obsessing because I just want closure and to get back to normal.

I do have access to online test results, and the ultrasound results showed up today. I understand most of it, but one part is confusing to me. The doctor wrote ""Small volume of free fluid in pelvis.""

Does anyone know what this means? Googling led to totally different conclusions, ranging from ""totally normal"" to ""ectopic pregnancy."" I just want to know what my next steps are. I wish my doctor had called me today 🙁

Thanks. Wish I didn't have to be a part of this group, but I'm grateful for everyone here.",t3_iilz2a

But she also didn’t even tell me she was trying/ had her IUD removed. And that’s making me so angry but I want to be there for her too. Does anyone have any advice? I’m bringing over a basket of things I loved during my first couple of days afterward. But I just. Don’t know.",t3_iilidc
1063,Miscarriage,"Red is the color of strawberries in spring, staining the mouths of children who smile in delight.  The color of cherry Icees, so refreshing on a hot summer day.  Red is the color of passion, lipstick that leaves marks on someone's skin.  The color of confidence, a red dress for a first date.  


Red is the color of every car I've ever owned, each one with so many memories. Not to mention the color of my favorite ninja turtle, Raphael. 


Red is my favorite color, Tuesday was the first time I was devastated to see it.  That day I woke up feeling like something wasn't right. 


I went to the bathroom and red stained the toilet paper.  I immediately called my doctor, I had an ultrasound appointment later in the day to determine my due date so they asked me to keep my appointment and they'd check everything out.  The color red remained on my mind,  but it hadn't been much so I felt like maybe it was ok after all.


Because of Covid, I had go to the doctor alone.  Nobody else was allowed in the office.  I was determined to be brave, told myself everything was fine and they'd confirm it with my ultrasound. They called my name and I went back and they began.


""How far are you?"" She asked, in a worried tone.


""8 and 1/2 weeks."" I whispered nervously.


She didn't comment except to say the baby was measuring smaller than that and printed out a picture for me.  But her next sentence made me aware that something wasn't right.


""I know you don't have an appointment to see the doctor today, but I'm going to see if they will work you in.""  


I nodded and went back out to the waiting room and kept looking at my picture,  the one glimpse I had of our baby.  They called my name and I felt like I was doing a march to my death.  The look on the doctor's face told me everything I needed to know.  


I could only see her eyes because of the mask but I wasn't shocked when she said, ""The baby has a very low heartbeat.  That combined with your bleeding makes us think this isn't a viable pregnancy.""


She gave me more information,  but all I could hear was the sound of blood rushing in my ears. I made some comments about how I knew it was a possibility and I was ok and did whatever I could to get out of there.


Sitting in my car, I called Mark.  He was going to come home to be with me.  We just spent the day together waiting for the inevitable to happen. 


Red.  The color of blood that lets me know this is happening.  That the baby I carried in my womb, the baby I just saw with the flicker of a heart beat, is gone.  


Red. The color stains my clothes now.  Stains my mind now.  So much red that I never want to see it again.


I grieve for what we've lost, for the future we no longer have.  I grieve for what should've been.  I'm angry at the pregnant women I see who aren't following the guidelines and still get to keep their baby.  I'm angry at my body for what feels like a betrayal.",t3_iih6ex
1064,Miscarriage,"I want to start by apologizing if this is a redundant post.  This is all new to me.  

5 years of trying to conceive without a single positive test.  1 round of IVF yielding one egg.  That one egg turned into one embryo.  That one embryo happened to implant and the whole time I felt uncomfortably lucky.  

I was too afraid to talk about it until close to 12 weeks.  After every possible genetic test (genetic screenings/counseling, NIPT, NT scan) and 4 perfect ultrasounds, I reluctantly agreed to a gender reveal and at 16 weeks I bought her first outfits.   I let my guard down and made an announcement on instagram.  I planned out her nursery and we agreed on a name - we were going to have a daughter named Stella.   

I had a bedtime routine of shower, pull out the doppler, listen to her heartbeat for a minute, then go to sleep.  Every single night we found a perfect, strong heartbeat within 5 second of placing the doppler.  On Wednesday night, 5 minutes of searching and nothing.  I woke up 4 hours later, searched for it - nothing.  I woke up at 8am and searched for it.  Nothing. 

Ultrasound confirmed that she'd died on Tuesday at just two days shy of 20 weeks.  At almost halfway there.  I heard her heartbeat for the last time probably just hours before it stopped. 

Now what?  

I am utterly lost.  I am constantly aware of the stillness in my belly.  I can barely figure out how to put one foot in front of the other.  Between breakdowns, I'm a zombie and my husband is left trying to figure out how to console me while dealing with his own grief. Instead of having my anatomy scan next Wednesday, I'll be recovering from a D&amp;E the day before.  

How do you tell people what has happened?  Or do you just not?  Do you leave the announcement and gender reveal video on your instagram or take it down?   What do you do with the clothes you've bought and the gifts you've received?  

Then my mind heads to the darker questions:  How am I supposed to carry my lifeless daughter for the next four days?  The cruel duality here is that I also don't want her taken away on Tuesday.  What happens to your fully developed, miniature baby once it's removed from your womb?  Am I allowed to see her or have her little body cremated?  Can there be anything that remains for me to keep?  How do you honor her existence when she only ever really existed to you?  How do you face starting expensive fertility treatment all over again knowing that this is something that can ultimately happen?  How do you not resent another possible pregnancy for not being her?  

If anyone has any insight to help me get through the next couple of days, I would really appreciate it because I'm stuck in this tunnel and I can't see any light at the end.",t3_iif4i6
1065,Miscarriage,"I found out at my ultrasound appointment this past Monday (at what would have been 9 weeks) that I have a blighted ovum. The gestational sac was completely empty so I take it nothing has been in there for a while. I had bloodwork that day and then went back on Wednesday. Both my progesterone and my HCG fell a little bit between those two days which basically proves what is happening (HCG went from 81,000 to 71,000 and progesterone went from 15.5 to 14.1). I still have to go back next Wednesday for another ultrasound to rule out ectopic. Before the bloodwork my doctor was also originally saying maybe I was just wrong about my dates so they wanted me to come back for another ultrasound to be sure. I guess its a good thing to be sure, but I was actually pretty insulted when she said this to me as if I was somehow an entire month wrong on my period and was just an idiot. I'm not really a fan of false hope. As of today I've yet to have any bleeding, although there are some mild cramps but I think they may be psychosomatic because they started right when I found out about the blighted ovum. 

My doctor hasn't discussed any options with me yet because she wanted to wait until the bloodwork and final ultrasound, but from what I've seen online most people seem to choose a D&amp;C, and the ones who go natural take medication to make the process start. Has anyone here gone the completely natural route of just letting their body do everything on its own without any pills? I'm personally very wary of medical intervention and have always felt like its better in the long run to let my body handle things on its own unless theres some severe complication. (No judgement at all to those of you who made different choices, they just don't feel right for me). Does anyone have any experience with this? Just kind of wondering what to expect.

1066,Miscarriage,"I (24X, they/them please) have had three miscarriages in the last 12 months. I had one in October, one in January, and one in March. I didn’t intend to get pregnant, my (now former) partner didn’t support me in the way that I needed during these times or after the fact, &amp; I feel like my body is straight up different now. I am obsessed with pregnancy, think about/dream about having kids or miscarrying almost every night, and panic when my period comes thinking it’s happening again even though it’s not.

Has anyone else noticed their body &amp;amp; mood just feel, different? I tried to google this &amp;amp; nothing came up. I really just would love to hear from others.",t3_iilbrb
1067,Miscarriage,"I had less than 4 hrs to read through this sub for help, but all the detailed experiences really helped me make my decision and then be confident in it. I’m hoping sharing this helps someone else. So while it’s fresh, here we go....






Wednesday afternoon I found out that I had a MMC.  Was given the 3 options, but had to make a decision that day as OBGYN was leaving Friday. We decided to go for the D&amp;C. I just had no faith in my body to take care of this, it had been fooled for 3 weeks after all. I did not want to deal with any more of the loss and couldn’t handle doing so at home physically or emotionally. Or go through it all and need the procedure anyway. Plus with the D&amp;C things could be over and we could move forward. We got it scheduled.


So yesterday (Thursday) I went in, DH could only drop me off and pick me up. I was worried about him more than myself. 



So he dropped me off and a nurse met me, first doing a rapid covid test right there practically in the entrance. It wasn’t pleasant, but not as deep and bad as I was expecting. I’m assuming that it was negative as I never heard anything...Got my blood drawn and sent to surgery. My pre-op nurse set me up in my private area and we went through the whole shpeal. She was wonderful and sensitive and apologetic, but didn’t press it. They wanted me to pee, but after having no water or food since midnight I had nothing. I felt so dehydrated and nauseous all day. My body did not get the memo and I was still experiencing pregnancy symptoms. I was feeling like vomiting bad. Got my IV in first try, heart monitors and everything hooked up. I was offered TV but opted for my phone where I played Tetris and texted DH. I was checked on intermittently for the next half hour. My appointment time came, and went. I could tell by the monitors it was stressing me out. It was only 10 minutes late but felt like an eternity. Finally my OB came in and we went over everything, signed the forms and then she was gone. Anesthesia came in, asked me all the same questions I had already answered  and filled out, but then I was alone again. 



Then suddenly pre-op nurse and 2 others are in there doing their stuff and wheel me off. Pre-op nurse yells for me to think positive thoughts and she disappears. OB is waiting in the OR and was holding my hand. She kept saying sorry which I appreciate her trying to be nice but like stfu I’m trying to stay positive here. I’m on the table and I hear someone behind me say they are giving me a relaxer in the IV then I don’t really remember much minus someone trying to take my mask off. ( it had been on the whole time) I also know they gave me antibiotics to prevent infection. 


And woke up to two nurses saying my name, it felt like they were yelling at me, but I just don’t like being woken up period and was ignoring them so who knows. Finally realized what’s going on and noticed right away some period like cramps and lower back pain. I immediately asked for water, but they could only do ice chips. They were sooo good though. I tried to ask how it went, but it came out “did they work” so no real answer could be given. (DH later told me when they called they told him everything went well). I warned them I was bleeding on the bed and they brought a pad. It wasn’t a ton. Chilled for a bit, pain let up, a different nurse was there with me now and I ended up needing a shot for being RH-. Got some apple juice, went over some discharge information (she later repeated to DH in the car as well) and carefully had me get up in stages and led me to my stuff. Maybe 45 minutes from fully awake to changing. 


Got some mesh panties and a pad and got dressed, mask on , and was wheeled out to the car. ( I had worn leggings but thankfully brought loose shorts also, wearing leggings would have been tough) 


Got home, went straight for some water and just chilled with DH and the dogs. Ate a bite or three of DHs pizza but just wanted that sweet sweet water. Finally able to pee and no pain, and a period amount of blood in the pad. Did not have much pain the rest of the day. Bit of a headache and scratchy throat. The anesthesiologist said as I ate and drank more it would go away. My pregnancy symptoms are virtually gone. I  am no longer nauseous, boobs less tender, and smells are not sending me running, just turning my head.  That alone is reason enough for me to be glad in my decision. I couldn’t stand another 3-4 weeks waiting for nature to do its thing, while feeling pregnant still. If I’m not getting my baby I have to reason to suffer through. 


I was in the hospital for a total of 3 1/2 hours. (Then the pharmacy parking lot for 30 mins.) I wore my silicone wedding ring the entire time which helped me feel better about being alone. 



I’m surprised in how not tired I was last night. Could not fall asleep until 1:30 and woke up at 5 with a headache and slight cramps. Just slight spotting overnight. Hopefully my body lets me nap today.

It's been 7 years and I thought that I was making good progress with the grieving process until recently. 

My sister found out that she is pregnant and I am TERRIFIED of a miscarriage happening to her because of how much it hurt me. I'm accidentally projecting some negativity onto her because of it and it's because of my unresolved trauma.

1078,Miscarriage,"I just had my first miscarriage (second pregnancy) a week ago. I'm still processing, because I was only 3 - 4 months pregnant. 

Here is a little backstory of how the day had went down. I'll leave out any horrific details but fair warning, I will mention briefly about blood..

After quite a bit of crying and denail, I went to the ER at 4:30 am (I knew around 2:30 am). We sat in the empty lobby room for almost an hour before we (my husband and I) got a bed. I had already bled through my jeans and changed into some sweat pants. I waited for the nurse, Jeff, who finally showed up about this time was around 5:50 am. I requested for some sanitary pads as I noticed mine was needing replaced (we forgot extras when we had left the house). About 20-30 mins go by, a nurse came to take my blood and I asked again. She said she would find somebody for me. Then about another 30 mins go by, and a Dr. Shows up, asks me the same questions I've answered three times now. Tells me that I will not be getting an ultrasound until 8 am. It's 7 am at this point. Asked the Dr for a pad and told me she'd find someone.

 Well, day shift nurse arrive, Pat, comes in and finds me sitting a pool of blood on the bed at this point (and now have no pants to wear.). Helps me by changes the sheets and getting me cleaned up. She finally gets a blood pressure/ heart rate monitor on me (which I did not have hooked up beforehand which is why I did not have a call button). Go through the entire miscarriage by the time I get the ultrasound. I didn't realize how painful it was going to be. Nobody prepared me of what exactly was going to happen at all. I guess I didn't ask the right questions... We left at 10 am that morning.. While waiting for the discharge paperwork, was went my husband cried. Not before or not after. It made my heart ache.. 

But anyway..

The reason I created this post is because the emotions are all crashing at once. I believe I was in such denial the past few days, I didn't realize how much this miscarriage has effected me.. It went from no feelings to my heart aching constantly. I tried going to work Wednesday, and realized how bad it really was. Being home with my 16 month old and my husband have kept me in such a bubble.. 

Going back to work makes me feel like things are just going back to normal, like nothing I have just went through the past few months have mattered anymore. I feel like I'm not allowed to be happy. That every smile or laugh I make, makes me feel like a terrible person. People are treating me like I am about to cry at any moment, like nothing can cheer me up. That's not the case, my son or husband makes me smile and then I have this guilty feeling of being happy right after a loss... 

I work night shift/ my husband day shift, so our sleep schedule is off. The nights have become longer, as I try to get my mind off of the experience I just went through... I cry while my husband is asleep so he doesn't have to feel bad about it constantly. I distract myself with tv/movies/videogames/food to avoid thinking about it or talking about it...

I'm sorry for the long post, I just need some advice from someone who has been in the same situation as I have.. I can talk to my friends about it, but they aren't able to compare or give advice. They are here for me and I appreciate it all.. I just don't feel like throwing a pity party everytime they message me or talk to me...

Thanks for anyone who bothered to read til the end.. I feel better the more I write this whole thing out.. Sorry for any grammar or misspelling issues..",t3_ii4nva
1079,Miscarriage,"I don't really have anywhere to share this. If it feels spammy or unhelpful I'm happy to delete.

""You are strong, you are supported, you are loved."" You whisper the words in your car where no one can hear you, your hand resting on your abdomen is the physical sign the words aren't meant for yourself, but for the new soul growing inside you. 

The first time you see those double lines your mind goes blank with shock. You custom order a cake and use references from your husband's favorite  show to make the picture perfect surprise announcement. You giggle and exclaim and plan to keep it a secret until you know everything is fine, only to tell half your friends the very next day. You're hesitant, you know things can go wrong and try and fail not to fall head over heels in excitement for what is to come. You're nauseous, and exhausted, and sore, and hungry every second despite not wanting to eat anything. But you relish it because every ping of nausea reminds you of how much you love what is growing, of how lucky you feel that there are no signs of anything wrong. And then two months of dreaming in you get to the appointment, disappointed that thanks to the pandemic your husband can't be there to see your child's image for the first time, or hear the heartbeat; but so ready to finally get that confirmation everything is fine. 

And then there's silence. You sit alone in the hallway waiting for the doctor to confirm what you already know. You try to hold it together enough to listen to your options, to decide if you want the physical pain of medicine, the emotional pain of waiting, or the financial pain of surgery; you know some women end up with all three. You have to wait a week, to confirm. And in that week you go back to work, and your body hasn't realized. And now the pings of nausea that come make you want to scream, or cry, or hit something. Because how is it fair to still be so pregnant knowing there is no baby coming?

The second time you see the pink lines there is hope, there is joy, but they are overshadowed by fear. You wake your husband and briefly tell him the news before giving him a kiss goodbye as you leave for the workday. This time you tell fewer people. When things go wrong it's less shocking, less painful, and yet more destructive. The doctor and the old sayings both tell you that if you get pregnant right after a miscarriage it's more likely to be successful. Everyone says once  you have one it's statistically unlikely to have another. So you had hope. But when that hope is proven wrong what do you have left?

The third time you see the lines you consider just leaving the test in the bathroom for your husband to come across. It no longer means anything except anxiety. You don't start wondering what the gender will be, instead you ask yourself ""I wonder how long this one will last."" You don't tell a soul. When it ends it feels like a cut on numb skin. Something you know should hurt but you can't bring yourself to feel. Why is everything so much harder than it needs to be? At this point it no longer points to just bad luck, so you have to ask, what is wrong with me?

The first time you're angry. You lose it over small things. You about get yourself in hot water going off at work about everything and everyone.

The second time you're desperate. You use your lunch hours to break down in the car. You come this close to quitting your job. Because surely there has to be something you can change to make things work out differently. Surely it can't actually be this out of your control.

The third time you're withdrawn. You have no energy or desire for pretty much anything. For the first time you question if this will ever happen for you.

But you learn things too.

The first time you learn your coworkers have your back. They'll listen to you rant because they know you need to be angry about something easier to face, so they'll let you without taking it in. You learn it's okay to have boundaries, to unfollow social media accounts of people expecting and going through the newborn years. You learn to take time doing the things that calm you. 

The second time you learn to find a therapist. You learn not to put your attendance record at a job that doesn't care for you over your own wellbeing. You learn to accept the love of friends bringing/sending you care packages to keep you stocked with sweets and chocolates at all times. You learn you are surrounded by honestly wonderful people that care about you more than your anxiety let you realize.

The third time you learn that sometimes you have to let go of always planning for the future and live for now. That it's okay to spend some money when you have it on things you want, instead of always worrying about things you may need. You learn to focus on the love that fills your life now.

The past year has been a difficult one. And yet I still feel blessed. I feel blessed to be surrounded by the people that I am. I feel blessed to have jobs through uncertainty. I feel blessed that one way or another I know I will see my husband be the amazing father I know he will be, and that we will have a family of our own.

Would you kindly tell me what helped you a lot after you miscarried, whether it's emotional or hands-on support? Or also what you would have wished for? 

My very close friend has had a miscarriage this week and she's heartbroken, of course. 26 weeks in. She's recovering but does not want to see anyone yet but promised to call me as soon as she's on her feet again, so her husband told me. I feel kind of helpless in how to support her, as we're both rather young (mid twenties) and never had a comparable loss in our friend group. She was really looking forward to the baby and we've already prepared so much stuff. I've had the honor to build a wooden cradle and that made me so happy and proud to be an ""auntie"" soon. I'm scared to talk about how much that loss impacts me too, as I feel I had no right as I'm only a friend and not the mother herself. I don't want to undermine her feelings.

I really wish I had more time to read one or two books about the topic but I feel I need to act asap as soon as she's ready to communicate to the outside again. 

I'm devastated and I would be very grateful for any advice.",t3_ii3u9u
1081,Miscarriage,"My husband is going to be back from his work trip tomorrow night. I’m equally dreading and looking forward to his return. He doesn’t know that I miscarried yet. I was roughly four months along.

I made the decision to not tell him while he was gone because he is out of state and I knew that knowing and not having the ability to be here would be worse for him than not knowing. I went through most of it alone before I asked my SIL for help when I was going through the worst of it. 

I really want to cry about it with him, or at least just be with him. On the other hand, I’m scared he’ll be upset that I kept this from him. I’m really just looking for the right words to say to him. I feel like shit, emotionally, physically, and mentally.",t3_ihzsu5
1082,Miscarriage,Sometimes I can’t find the right words to say. You left too soon. Not here to stay. I miss you although I never go to see you. I loved you although I never got to hold you.

1083,Miscarriage,"...with blood stains. My doctor said not to worry about anything more than light spotting. That’s how this started and now it’s getting heavier. I’m starting to get worried. I can’t tell yet how much worse the bleeding is getting, so I am gonna wait a bit. I am about 6.5 weeks pregnant. What would I expect from an emergency room visit?",t3_ii63aa
1084,Miscarriage,"I am 10 weeks with a 5 week gestational sac. No fetal pole or yolk sac. Between my ultrasounds (to confirm blighted ovum) the sac actually shrunk 2mm. I knew my body was catching on. 

Tuesday I started to spot and had mild cramps through the night. Wednesday was the day. I would describe it as heavy period blood and mild cramping that became intense/sharp at certain moments. In those moments I’d want to sit on the toilet. 

The blood loss has been very reasonable and yesterday and today so far is period like with more mild, off and on cramping. 

With a 5 week sac and nothing else in there I guess my question is how much “tissue” compared to just heavy blood should I expect? I am fearful the sac is yet to come or I missed it coming out? Is that possible? I’ve had some blood clots come out but they were all smaller than a penny. Part of me is guessing the sac is too? It measured 7mm but I know that’s diameter/average. 

I am fearful I will still need medical intervention since I haven’t seen the sac. I hate that - so hoping for at least some peace of mind that maybe this is as bad as it will get? 

I’ll confirm with blood work and an ultrasound next week if I am still concerned.

1087,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone, 

Firstly, I want to say that made this account just to post here. My wife and I are currently going through our first miscarriage in our first pregnancy at 6w+5 (discovered at 8)...needless to say, it's been hard, but I've been reading a lot of your stories and getting inspired from the perseverence and strength of the members in this sub. 

Our OB offered us the D&amp;C or taking the 2-pill medicated procedure at home next week...we are opting for the latter option for fear of scarring (we live in a small town, I'm sure that the surgeons are great but perhaps don't see as many patients as in bigger cities). I must have read a hundred experience posts regarding the medical MC and it sounds rough. We know that it will be painful, and that the length of the actual process may vary. Our OB will prescribe medication, and we'll have a phone number on hand in case of emergency. 

My focus is on supporting my wife in the physical and emotional pain that is to come., though she is a tough cookie and I'm sure she'll do great (she has been very supportive of my own grief). My question is, for those who have gone through it, was there anything particularly helpful that your partner/spouse did for you throughout the process? I am prepping a heated blanket and hot water pad. Were you able to eat solid food before/after? How many pads/what type of pads did you stock up on beforehand? Is there anything you wished that you had on hand? If your partner or family member did anything that was particularly helpful, I hope you wouldn't mind sharing with me (and for the benefit of anyone else who might have the same question). 

Many thanks in advance. 

TLDR; My spouse is about to undergo medical MC and I'd like to know how best to help her during the process.",t3_ihzfc3

1090,Miscarriage,"This was my 2nd chemical pregnancy and I didn't want to go to an ER because I knew there was nothing they could do for me, but I was told to go just to make sure. My body gave me clear signs that I was pregnant but I waited until the 2nd day of my missed period to test. It was positive and I was hopeful because I believed this one would stay. Then, the same thing happened. I knew it was a very, very early loss. I didn't get to go to the 1st appointment, but the moment I knew it was in here; there was a bond.  Scared, disappointed and hurt. My husband was not allowed to come into the ER with me because of Covid. I was alone on the hospital bed and the doctor came in and told me ""you weren't pregnant. You just had period"". I felt utterly stupid. Like I was so stupid I didn't know it was a period and not a miscarriage. Maybe the doctor thought that I was so hopeful that I thought I was pregnant but I was not? The test at home clearly had 2 lines. My husband confirmed it. Maybe the doctor thought if he acted like it was nothing, then it was nothing. Maybe it was a very, very, very early loss that it was nothing. But this emotional roller-coaster was rough, and the physical pain was so real. I was sad, but at the same time I thought I shouldn't be sad because it was ""just a late period"" like the doctor said. Was it so early that feeling upset or sad is just too dramatic? Is it just a ""late period""?",t3_ihyghd

1092,Miscarriage,"How long did it take you to have a negative pregnancy test.

I had my first positive July 21st and had immediate signs of miscarriage. The highest recorded level of hCG was 345. The hospital wants me in every week to do bloodwork until my levels are below 5. It has been well over a month and I took an at home test yesterday (8 days after my last blood draw hCG was at 75) and I am still getting a positive result...

Is it typical to take so long to work off the pregnancy hormone??? Maybe just looking for someone to tell me it isn’t just me?",t3_ihvcab
1093,Miscarriage,"Two days ago I was 6 weeks pregnant. I was counting down the days until my first ultrasound (still 2 weeks away). We had names picked out for both genders. Before bed each night we talked about what the baby might look like, how our lives would change. I was so in love with this baby already. I knew deep down that I should be more cautious, but how can you be when there is a life literally growing inside of you?

Sex has always been painful for me. It took my husband and I years to be able to have sex without me writhing in pain. When we started trying, I couldn't believe we got pregnant on the first try. I felt so accomplished.

The bleeding happened so suddenly. First, just a spot. I told myself not to worry, but I had this gut feeling. An hour later, the cramps ramped up. I'd had light cramping throughout, but nothing like this. The pain kept me up all night, made me tremble and vomit. I spent the night in the bathroom. I know the moment I miscarried - I could just feel it and tell.

My sister gave me some hope. She'd had something very similar happen at 9 weeks, but the baby turned out to be fine. She insisted I go to the ER. I went and had an ultrasound and a pelvic exam. They found no baby, but said my cervix was closed, so they were confused. The doctor told me it was most likely a miscarriage, but I'd need more blood work to confirm.

My blood work showed I was in the low-normal range for 6 weeks. I have to get more blood work done Friday to compare, but I know the numbers will be down.

All yesterday and today I just have this gnawing emptiness and sadness. I don't know how to cope. My husband is here and he's great, but he's hurting, too. We ended up telling our parents for support, but I still feel so utterly alone and confused. How was I pregnant one day and the next day suddenly not anymore? When will I feel normal again? If I try to get pregnant again, how will I be able to trust my body?

I'm sorry for the long post. I know my experience isn't even that bad compared to some of yours. I'm just trying to wrap my head around these past couple of days. Thanks for reading and I hope you're all finding peace.",t3_ihl2ot
1094,Miscarriage,"I just got home from getting lab tests done to confirm if I had a MC. This is (was?) my first pregnancy. I'm only about six and a half weeks along, on Monday I began spotting &amp; cramping, and it has got progressively worse since then. Last night there was a considerable amount of tissue passed, and this morning the literal floodgates opened. My boobs have been extremely sore throughout my whole pregnancy and when I woke up today they felt normal again, which leads me to believe that I may have passed the fetus. I'm waiting now to get a call about the lab tests. I feel so lost. I never really wanted kids until recently, and I feel like this is what I get for being ""child-free"" for a good portion of my life. A cruel joke. I don't know if I even want to try again because this heartbreak is so painful, you all know this too well unfortunately. I don't really know what the point of this post was. I guess it's just comforting to know I'm not going through this alone. Bless y'all for reading my rambling.


Edit: Well yesterday I spent 6 hours in the ER, it was confirmed to be a MC. I'm still bleeding and passing tissue today, but I feel a thousand times better physically and I'm doing my best to get there mentally/emotionally as well. My husband has been so supportive and I'm very grateful for him. If you're going through the same thing right now I am so incredibly sorry, I feel your pain. Take time to let yourself be upset. Eat that pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream. Cry and scream if that's what you feel you need to do. Whatever you feel you need to do is valid. Just know there is no wrong way to grieve and we are all here to support each other.

1095,Miscarriage,"
I wasn't trying. But I was happy, and my husband was stoked and wanted to tell everyone and their mother. 
I found out when I was 4+3 and had an intake appointment set for when I was 5+5. The canceled it less than 20mins before the appointment and never bothered to call and I showed up. They got rude and said maybe I should have called to confirm. Set a new appointment and same thing, canceled same day, about 30mins before and I showed up. So now I'm 7 weeks and still no intake appointment. I start calling around to look for a new OB, no one is seeing new patients due to covid or the wait is 1-2mos long. I have a blood clotting disorder and so need care sooner. I make an appointment with another provider for when I'm about 14 weeks but still set up appointments with the current OB hoping to get some kind of care, I finally got an appointment, the doctor was totally rude. Made assumptions about my martial status (called me a single baby momma), told me I was too old to be having babies (I'm 35), wanted to know since it was unplanned did I just need a confirmation for the abortion clinic, talked about what type of permanent birth control I wanted, tubes tied, implant, IUF etc. I was fucking blown. Glad I made the choice to switch, they took blood and I left. 

At 9+3 I started bleeding with no prior MC symptoms. Like pouring blood everywhere, while I was at work. They wouldn't let me leave (or be fired)  so I sucked it up and kept going, about 4 hours into my shift, 3 hours after I started heavily bleeding, I felt a giant clot pass with a huge gush and rushed to the bathroom. There was my perfect little tiny baby in a perfect tiny little bubble laying in all that blood. It had gone down my legs, through my pants, gushed through the double stack of pads I was wearing and I was soaked. 
I called out to my manager from the doorway and explained what happened (minus the miscarriage, didn't think it was her business) and she STILL didn't want me to leave. But I left anyways. I literally had my baby in a goddamn sandwich baggie in my pocket and the seat of my pants was soaked in blood. Took myself to the ER and the staff was very caring. Was in and out in about 2 hours, got numerous tests, the ER doc was very caring and called the situation bullshit and fucked. I appreciated the obscenities.

My OBgyn is on the higher end scale, highly recommended from his previous practice. Rude. Dismissive. Assuming. Ordered tests and never told me anything. I was in the middle of switching to a new practice when I had my MC spontaneously and had to return to the original doctor for aftercare. None of other offices wanted to take MC post care patients. He didn't run labs. Refused to fill out my LOA paperwork. Refused to acknowledge that I am still in pain. He didn't do a checkup or ultrasound. I basically sat in a chair on the side of the room while he told me that I should take triple the recommended dose of Advil PM to get some sleep. I haven't been sleeping because I've been in pain, the lack of sleep is causing migraines, which is making the pain worse and the sleeping harder. All after I told him the prescribed ibuprofen stopped working. He told me to go back to work and getting put of bed an being active would help stop the abnormal bleeding im having. 

The front staff was no better, I called the Monday after my MC and canceled all my prenatal appointments and dating scans and bloodwork. And scheduled my follow-up for the MC, yesterday. When I got there they had no idea why I was being seen, asking me in a room full of pregnant people why I was being seen today, ive never cried so many times in public. The whole 10 days even tho I had canceled twice, I was still getting notifications for my upcoming prenatal appointments. And after the hoopla with the doctor during the appointment and the nurse who had no idea why I was there, when I asked the scheduler to make sure all my appointments were canceled she made me loudly say why in the waiting room which was still full of pregnant people. I just started sobbing. 

Today I went at the recommendation of my husbands friend to the medical university OB clinic which mostly serves the uninsured population. Almost like a free clinic. He phoned ahead and they were waiting for me. They were all so kind. They got me into ultrasound right away and the doctor was looking and goes ""oh look, there it is, I can see your pain right there."" I'm 11 days post mc that the ER diagnosed as complete, she found a big blob of retained tissue that is it doesn't pass in a week she will schedule a d&amp;c for me. She filled out my paperwork and called my previous doctor and got all my records and blood work. She figured out that my MC was preventable and that I had needed progesterone, blood thinners and iron as I'm anemic. She's already called again today to check on me and said if I cannot sleep tonight, to call back tomorrow and she will help me. 
I will never return to the first OB. He is a terrible doctor. He should lose his license.
My mental health is in the fucking trash. I feel at fault for sticking with the first doctor for so long and not asking anyone for helping finding a new one. My husband has been so thoughtful and sweet, doing his best to care for me since I haven't done much to care for myself. I can't even be bothered. I'm so tried of fucking crying. I'm so tired of not sleeping. After months of not smoking, I started smoking again, yeah I know it's not helping with the bleeding and healing, but goddamn it I'm tired. 

TL;DR my doctor could have probably prevented my MC if he wasn't such a judgmental asshat. Also I've been crying a lot and watching Shameless.",t3_ihcc9t

So I delivered my 16 week old baby Monday afternoon. I held him but it freaked him out and so I had the nurses take him away. Later I tried to see him again and his lifeless half formed body scared me and asked him to be taken away again. I let the hospital take him instead of giving him a service. 

I feel SO guilty. I feel horrible I didn’t want to hold him. I feel horrible I didn’t get him cremated and take him with us. I don’t know what happens in the afterlife. I feel like he’s so alone in a hospital mortuary. I was the only other person he “knew” and I didn’t want to to hold him, didn’t want to take him. I feel like he’s just so alone. At the time I felt like it was just his body. And I still feel that way, but some deep part of me has awoken and started aching that I didn’t do enough for him, that he’s just alone. I feel like I didn’t love him enough and it’s breaking my heart. 

My husband keeps reassuring me that we did everything we could and that that was just his body. But this dark part of me keeps creeping in and overriding the numerous people telling me I did everything I could. I know this feeling of guilt is part of the stages of grief and all that stuff.. do you just have to sit with the feeling until peace washes over you?

1097,Miscarriage,"I (26F) ultrarunner on Sunday (6w), presented to the ED because I was worried about some spotting/clots. This is my first pregnancy, so I wasn't sure if this was normal or not. First of all, going to the hospital when this is happening is frightening and isolating, as you just want answers about what is going on. When you add COVID into the mix, it makes the experience 10x worse, as you are having to play the waiting game completely alone, as no one else is allowed to wait with you. After 5 hours of waiting, blood work &amp; an ultrasound, I was given inconclusive information-- I was told that due to the ultrasound &amp; blood work contradicting one another, that I was most likely either experiencing a threatened miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. I was instructed to follow up with my OB/GYN 2 days later for a follow up ultrasound and more blood work to check my HCG levels.
My physician talked me through what the course of action would be if I was in fact experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, and what he would be looking for when I had my blood drawn. He was hopeful that he still could not rule out a loss, and there was still a potential viability for this pregnancy. However, this afternoon I got a call from him, affirming that I was in fact having a miscarriage. My HCG levels dropped from ~1500 to ~300 from Sunday to Tuesday.
As I had not told anyone about the pregnancy (other than DH), I feel really alone and in need of support. I feel so uncertain of how to process all of this, especially since it was such an early loss. I tend to be a very private person, so it makes me even more uncertain of how to ask for help to get me through this. I am not sure this is all worth it, if an early loss like this was so emotionally taxing.",t3_ihcs9v

I had a transvaginal ultrasound which showed a 6 week pregnancy and no heartbeat so I guess i would call it a missed miscarriage. I was supposed to go in the next day for my first scan anyway. It was honestly one of the most traumatic things I’ve experienced. The ultrasound lasted for what seemed like forever, even after being told it was not viable. Thank god my husband was allowed to be with me because I was sobbing the whole time. I had to go get my blood drawn afterwards and cried in front of the lab person too.

In the ultrasound, the doctor saw that not only had none of the tissue passed, but that the placenta had continued to grow and was potentially a molar pregnancy. So i got a d&amp;c this past weekend on Sat (i was pretty scared). Ever since the d&amp;c, I feel SO much better! Lots of energy, no nausea, no food aversions. And I feel hopeful again. However still waiting to hear about the results of the tissue (full molar? Partial molar?). I am an athlete (rock climber) and I normally climb 5 times a week. However, my doctor said I have to not climb for 3 to 4 weeks after the d&amp;c. This doesn't make sense to me because I feel better than I have in months.

1107,Miscarriage,"In the last post I wrote in this sub, I had been informed about my MMC in my first Ultrasound (US). I was 12 weeks that Monday. You can read that post via my history. 

*Trigger Warning: This is my experience with D&amp;C. It is very detailed. My apologies if that is triggering to you. I found most comfort reading real detailed experiences from other members here so I am sharing my own story in the times of covid19 as a way of giving back.* 

Post being informed at my 12w US that my baby was only 6w6d, I underwent another HCG blood test on 12w1d (Tuesday). The results showed between the 9th week and 12th week my hcg had tripled from 33,000 to 98,000 (12w1d). My Dr recommended I wait for another two weeks to repeat the US, as from the blood tests there was no sign of miscarriage. The next two weeks I oscillated between hope and praying for grace.  

I went for a transvaginal US at 13w4d (Thursday), the baby still measured 6w6d, but my sac had grown and matched my calculated dates, my body was proceeding with the pregnancy as normal and was showing no signs of miscarrying. I was recommended to undergo a D&amp;C as the sac was too big to pass at home and there was a danger of infection now.

I was sent to the Emergency unit and then the Early Pregnancy Assessment Centre (EPAS) unit at my hospital directly from the US by my GP. I had to go alone in the building due to covid19 restrictions and my partner waited in the parking lot. That day I was waiting without food or water for 9 hours, with a face mask, and had meetings with the emergency room doctor who processed my referal to EPAS, the mid-wife and finally the gynec. I also underwent a covid19 test. My d&amp;c was scheduled for what would be my 14w1d (Tuesday), after five days. I was informed I was scheduled for a blind d&amp;c. I was told I might start spotting earlier and to use pads, but if the bleeding was heavy to come immediately to emergency. My partner and I headed back home after 9 hours of no food and water and had no energy left to grieve. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The night before.** 

I was asked not to drink water or eat post mid-night. No alcohol 24 hours prior. I take thyroxine for my hashimoto’s so I was allowed to take that with a sip of water at 6 am. I took off all my jewellery. I spent the day googling and reading other women’s d&amp;c experiences and got no work done. My covid19 test had come back negative earlier in the day.

Up until this point I was yet to spot or bleed a single drop of blood. I felt incredibly guilty for opting for a d&amp;c. I felt like my body had faith in the baby and wasn’t giving up and I was betraying it by choosing to abort. I didn’t want to let go of my baby and wanted to keep it safe within me. While I trust the US which told me that the baby wasn’t alive, there’s was that doubt saying, *What if they were wrong? What if my baby was alive? What if I am having twins, and they keep missing the alive twin?* I kept checking for spotting blood all night, but nothing happened. I wept at the thought that this was my last night being pregnant and going to sleep with my baby.

The alarm went off at 6 am. I showered and wore my flannel pajamas, sweatshirt, beanie, thick socks and sneakers. I had a bag packed with two pads, extra underwear, reading glasses, my iron and thyroxine medication, my cards (medicare, insurance, driver’s licence, credit card, little cash), my phone charger, hair clips, lip balm, face cream, headphones, a fleece jacket and a scarf. I donned my covid19 mask. 

I reached the hospital parking lot at 7:20 am and popped the two misoprostol tablets on the inside of my cheek to dissolve. The mid-wife gave me these tablets during my consultation the previous Thursday. They took a long time – about half an hour – and I felt guilty for initiating the process. I had yet not spotted even in the morning and still wanted to keep the baby. I couldn’t accept that my body was making such a big mistake and carrying on a pregnancy that died 7 weeks ago. 

There was some drama at the hospital entry because I tested febrile (38'C) entirely because I travelled in a heated car (it is very cold where I live, and it was 2'C outside in the morning). The lady at the entry completed over-reacted and despite my pleas to check my temperate again in five minutes, called up the day surgery, the covid19 and the emergency isolation department. I tested afebrile five minutes later (36.8 C) in the isolation room and they let me through to day surgery. I wasted 15 minutes in needless distress that I would be denied the d&amp;c and worried that I that I had already popped the miso pills. While I appreciate the lady was just doing her job, I think she over-reacted and could have just let my skin cool down. I was also made to change from my own cloth mask into a disposable mask provided by the hospital before entry.

Because of covid19 my partner wasn’t allowed to accompany me at all, and had to drop me off at entry point outisde the hospital and leave. 

I made my way to day surgery floor and registered at the entry desk at 7:50 am. I was tagged on both hands with a band with my details. The clerk reconfirmed my address, my medicare details, emergency contacts etc. The entire thing took five minutes. I sat down in the waiting area. I waited for about 20 minutes, and started to feel pressure in my uterus. Scared that I would soil my only pair of pants, I went to the toilet and wore my pad even though I wasn’t bleeding. 

Minutes later, a nurse took me through to a consultation room.

She was kind, and asked me questions regarding when I last ate or drank, whether I had any bleeding or pain (I told her I was feeling crampy), known allergies, previous experience with anaesthetics (none). She asked me if I had any dental plates, and I informed her my top two front teeth were crowns. I have had these for over five years, and while they are not loose, I had spent the day prior in extreme anxiety that I would be denied general anaesthesia and therefore the d&amp;c because of them. It probably sounds stupid now, but it was a very real fear for me. She checked in her system and informed me that while crowns weren’t listed as a danger I would do well to inform the surgeons. 

She explained to me that my d&amp;c would involve suction and scraping, but with an ultrasound to guide and hysteroscopy if required. That the procedure takes approximately 20 minutes but I could be asleep for up to an hour or even two after that. 

She gave me an information sheet on recovery post-D&amp;C, instructions to follow, and numbers to call for emotional support. 

I was taken to a small changing room with a mirror. All of my belongings and clothes had to be placed in a plastic bag and placed on a trolley outside the room with my name tags that were provided to me to attach on the outside. I put on a white hospital gown with ties in the back, disposable mesh white underwear which was entirely too big and I found it hard to keep the pad in place due to its size, a white robe, blue mesh booties (but I could keep my socks on, but no shoes) and a blue hair net. No eye contacts, jewellery or bras beyond this point. I was allowed to keep my phone with me and given a clear bag that I would need to place it and provide to the nurse before my surgery. 

It was 8:45 am and I was escorted to the waiting area which was right across the change room and shown the toilets. The waiting area was behind the nurse’s station and in a corridor. There were recliners, and I was provided a heated blanket. Through this entire process I had kept my face mask on. There were three other women waiting there. All of us were gowned and masked up. I was given two Panedol tablets by my nurse, as there was a delay due to some emergency and I could be waiting for a few hours, during which my cramps could get worse. I took these with two sips of water. Luckily I had my phone to pass time.  

I kept oscillating between chatting with my husband, surfing the internet and dozing off to sleep. 

Finally at 10:45 am the anaesthetist consulted one of the ladies in the waiting room. I listened carefully for questions around loose or cracked teeth, but this lady had perfect teeth (unfortunately for me). She was taken for her procedure 15 mins later by the same gynec /epas team I had met on Thursday. Next at 11 am the anaesthetist consulted with another lady who had a gap in her teeth, he checked if she had mobility in her lower jaw and was able to open her mouth wide. Which she was. Both these ladies were both informed that their anaesthesia involved intubation, and I was getting worried by the second. 

At 11:45 am the epas gynec assistant called my name and lead me directly to the operating room. The anaesthetist was in the room and didn’t ask me any questions. The main gynec came up to me and introduced himself. They reconfirmed my name verbally and checked my wrist-tags, they asked me to repeat what procedure I was there for. 

I was lead to the bed, and the nurse took my blanket and robe off me. My gown ties were loosened and asked to step onto the bed carefully, and then untuck the gown from under my butt to the sides. 

The anaesthetist approached me. He was very kind and said he was sorry I was at the hospital in these circumstances, and that he would be there to take care of me through the procedure. The nurse attached the blood pressure monitor to my right arm and the ECG leads to my chest, apologising for the coldness, and talking me through what she was doing. 

The anaesthetist was to my left inserting the IV into the crook of my arm. I had informed the doctors on Thursday that I have dodgy, hard to locate, thin veins and was worried it would hurt. But he was proficient, and I barely felt anything as he quickly got the needle in place. Above me, the large, disc-shaped lights were off. Ahead, there was a clock on the wall and I remember looking intently at it, trying to record the time, but I could not concentrate. They took off my covid19 face mask and placed it on my chest. 

The nurse placed a gas mask on my mouth and nose and asked me to take deep breaths, the anaesthetic said he was going to give me a pain-killer for my comfort, and now I would go to sleep, he would see me on the other side in three, two and… I had dozed off. 

**Afterwards**

I woke up in a recovery room with two nurses around me, and images of new born babies on the wall across from me. The face mask had been placed back on me. The nurses were asking me if I knew my blood group, I answered. They asked me if I was feeling fine, and I said I did but very dizzy which they said was normal. They asked if they could move me to a ward. I consented. But I dozed off to sleep again as soon as I reached the ward. 

The nurse woke me up again after some time. The two ladies who were ahead of me for d&amp;c were there too. The nurse asked me about my pain and nausea. I just felt a bit tender around my uterus and dizzy, but the cramps were bearable, so I refused medication. I had no nausea. I was asked if I would like to eat or drink and I requested for some cold milk and water, which I was provided. I was also brought some veggie sandwiches and a jelly. I was told I can take off my mask to eat, but to wear it again as soon as I was done. I wasn’t feeling hungry initially, but once I started to eat I felt hungry and my dizziness subsided. 

I was bought my belongings and my phone. I noticed it was 12:45 pm. The entire thing had taken an hour. The nurse suggested that if I felt like it, I could change into my clothes and could leave in as early as 30 minutes, if I felt fine. I was informed I could have my husband come to the day surgery waiting room to pick me up. 

The nurse said that it would be likely that I’d feel a gush of blood when I stood up but that it was normal and not to worry. She also asked me to sit back if I felt any sign of weakness or nausea and not attempt to rush into changing.  When I stood up slowly, I realised that the doctors had wedged a pad between my legs after the surgery and that my disposable undies were gone. But I had also bleed a bit on the sheet and on the bed as the pad wasn’t secured. I was provided fresh pads to change into. I didn’t feel any gush and changed into my clothes. 

After I dressed, I was guided to one of the nearby recliners to wait for my partner to get to the hospital. While I was waiting, the surgeon who performed my procedure came over to see me. He told me that everything went very well and they had sent the sample to the lab for testing. If there was bad news, he would call me in a week’s time. He asked me if I had questions, and I shared with me that I felt guilty for choosing the d&amp;c, I couldn’t understand why had no spotting at all, my hcg was so high, and why my body wasn’t miscarrying. He told me that they had looked at the sac and the baby, and while the sac was very big, the baby was very small. He told me that before the advent of US, cases like mines would continue to be pregnant until late second trimester at times, only to result in a petrified stillborn. I was relieved to hear that I had been spared this outcome. 

My partner arrived and we picked up food on the way back. I bought a bunch of cakes from my fav Greek bakery to gorge on. 

That afternoon I cuddled in blankets settled in for a Netflix binge of “Nailed it”. The bleeding was very light and bright red, like on day 4 or 5 of a regular period. I had mild cramps and didn’t feel the need for medication, a hot water bottle was sufficient. 

I took an Advil (200) at night just to ensure my sleep was undisturbed. My mood yesterday and today has been stable and calm. I am not sure if I was given anti-anxiety medication yesterday or if it the hcg still coursing through my veins. I will be praying for healing – both emotional and physical. 

To any person going through a miscarriage or a d&amp;c, you have my healing prayers and virtual hugs. A big thank you to all the women who shared their d&amp;c stories here. It really helped me.",t3_igqvtd
1108,Miscarriage,"Found this poem and wanted to share for everyone to know that your baby matters. Stay strong mommas❤️

The world may never notice
If a Snowdrop doesn't bloom,
Or even pause to wonder
If the petals fall too soon.
But every life that ever forms,
Or ever comes to be,
Touches the world in some small way
For all eternity.
The little one we longed for
Was swiftly here and gone.
But the love that was then planted
Is a light that still shines on.
And though our arms are empty,
Our hearts know what to do.
Every beating of our hearts
Says that we love you.",t3_igqn36
1109,Miscarriage,"This morning I started bleeding and this afternoon the cramps began. I don’t know what happened. I was four months along, everything with the pregnancy was going great considering it was completely unplanned... I just miscarried just of the blue. It hadn’t been a week since I last saw a doctor.

My husband is out of town for work. I’ll tell him when he comes home in three days. I’m just saving my emotions for then... or I’m still in shock from the whole situation. It won’t do he or I any good to know what’s going on if he’s not here. That, and I’m not even ready to talk about it to anyone besides internet strangers.

I’m pretty lost right now. This was my first pregnancy and now this is my first miscarriage. Could really use any advice or really just kind words would mean a lot right now.",t3_igtvxc
1110,Miscarriage,"I'm experiencing my first miscarriage (blighted ovum). I was given misoprostol and the first dose did not work. I took the second dose last night and I don't think it worked either. Now I'll probably have to get a D&amp;C. 

Miscarriages are already hard enough, why does it have to be more than one or 2 days of the physical stuff.  

I got angry at a car with a baby on board sign. I'm just so angry.

Sorry for my rant.",t3_igmdx8
1111,Miscarriage,"My procedure was 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I was 8 or so weeks at the time.

I hardly bled at all afterwards. Light spotting for maybe 5 days. I've been temping since then and have not ovulated yet (unsurprisingly, it's not been very long). 

My temp was very low this morning. It's been at the normal low pre-ovulation levels but this morning was a big dip. I'm also bleeding quite heavily, heavier than I did post-D&amp;C, and passing some clots. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm trying to figure out what's going on. This bleeding and temperature dip feel like a period, but 1) it seems too soon and 2) I didn't ovulate. I know I probably just need to accept some weirdness from my body right now but it's so hard for me not to overthink all this.",t3_ih0kn1
1112,Miscarriage,"I'm currently going through a natural miscarriage at 13 weeks.. I believe I passed the majority of things on Sunday when everything began. But I am still having bleeding and cramping/soreness which I know is normal. My question is, did anyone else have tired/cramping legs and frequent bowel movements? I'm guessing it's just weakness from blood loss/big changes/not eating a lot, not to mention its like 95 degrees out today and my AC stopping working 😑.. but I'm not sure. Also wondering if uterine cramping is causing intestinal cramping? I have tried looking things up.. but I can't really find anything. And the information packet the doctor gave me didn't list these things. 

Why is it so hard to find info on what really happens during a miscarriage? It just makes it feel even more lonely.",t3_ih04hs

1114,Miscarriage,"I’m so sorry this group even has to exist. I feel like absolute shit right now. Deep fried, ran over, shit. Everyone told me it would be fine, don’t worry, the tests aren’t too light, it’ll be fine. But it wasn’t fine! I’m losing the baby that I wanted more than anything. My first chemical 2 years ago I only knew about because I went to the doctor for something else. I wasn’t trying then and it hurt less. We tried for this one. We wanted this baby. We were ready. I cried a lot yesterday and I probably will cry some more today but I think I’ve reached numbness. My boyfriend is trying to get me to see the bright side that I can get pregnant but if I keep losing them then I’d rather just not be able to! I’d rather not know about them at all. Deleting pregnancy apps and leaving pregnancy groups feels like I’ve been punched in the gut, twice. I don’t know if I can try again. I told my boyfriend I might go back on birth control for now because I don’t want to experience this ever again. I don’t think I can handle it. I don’t want him to touch me anymore because that leads to sex and sex might lead me back here. The joy of pregnancy is forever stolen from me now. Who designed this? Who thought this was a good design? To dangle it in front of me and snatch it away a week later? I’m crushed.",t3_igczex
1115,Miscarriage,"And I'm still a complete mess. Everytime I think it's getting easier and that I'm finally moving past it, something triggers me and the meltdown starts again.

Today, it was that no one, but me, will ever say her name and the loneliness of that has sent me on a 4 hour long sobfest.

I keep telling myself that it will get easier, but it still hurts so much. Some days, it feels like a boulder on my chest and other days it's as sharp as a knife. 

It doesn't help that the entire process was such a nightmare. I have pernicious anemia and the blood loss was extreme and almost sent me into shock. I keep having flashbacks and dreams of everyone freaking out and it doesn't help.

I'm also pretty sure I'm about to start my period and that has me scared as hell. I feel like I have PTSD from all of this.",t3_igpe0g
1116,Miscarriage,"I had my first MC in January, and a second in July. So I should’ve been preparing to either give birth in 2 weeks or be telling friends, family and work.

Instead, my best friend had a baby 3 days before my first MC. Then found out another very close friend’s fiancée is due the same day as my first pregnancy. Then another friend announced their pregnancy on the day I confirmed my second MC, due a month before I was due.

My husband and I went on a wee staycation last week and I thought I was feeling better. Then today a friend tells me he and his wife are visiting from the country they live in, have been quarantined for 2 weeks and are popping by to our house tomorrow night. Great, any food allergies? What’s that? She can’t eat anything raw, or unwashed, or shellfish? Cool...

So that can only mean one thing. I just lost it. I haven’t texted him back. I’ve dropped out of every WhatsApp group this Summer so I’m already stepping out of my cotton ball to have guests over, but for them to be pregnant too. I absolutely lost it. My husband isn’t emotional in any way and doesn’t know how to comfort me and I literally want to take every plate in the kitchen and smash it and scream!

So I think I’m going to do the super mature thing and tell them I’ve come down with something and cancel them coming over. 

Yes I’m ugly and selfish and irrational but goddammit I’m going to grieve how I need to grieve and if that means self-isolating and blaming the pandemic then so be it.

1117,Miscarriage,"I had a d&amp;c for a miscarriage caused by a blighted ovum last Wednesday. I've been up and down hormonally and physically since, one day I'll feel normal, one day I'm literally sobbing from pain, I'll be fine and happy, then I'll be angry. 

Today was supposed to be a good day. It started out as a good day. Then my bleeding started to ramp up. And the cramps. I've gone from little to no spotting to full day two of my period with clots, filling pads, one in almost 45 minutes, but then it lightened. I can feel the blood coming out even even I'm lying down. 

The on call doctor told me to wait until morning to call my regular doctor or go to the ER if the bleeding gets to where I'm filling two pads an hour. 

I'm scared. I have two kids and two step kids, I have to pick up my daughter from her dad's tomorrow afternoon, my fiance's mom's wedding is this weekend, and I'm terrified that I'm bleeding and going to end up in the hospital or that I'm just overreacting

I'm just scared.",t3_igqh2t
1118,Miscarriage,"This is my 2nd mc and What a difference between the doctors. Background: my husband and I moved to Seattle form nyc we quickly chose our family doctor. She works at a clinic which speaks multiple languages. My own family don’t speak English and lives in Asia. We though Incase of emergency at least the doctor can speak to my family since my husband can’t. She was great and I have nothing against this clinic. For my first pregnancy I naturally went to them. They confirmed my pregnancy with pee test and scheduled my og appointment with them. Although I asked if I could go to a larger hospital or somewhere else they said they had their own og. I was naturally booked with theirs. Two days later I had my miscarriage mid 5 week close to 6. The doctor never had time to call me back I only got nurse on the other end. They did ask me to come in for blood but never rechecked on me or anything. They said they can do blood test now if I really want to. Didn’t offer ultra sound to make sure all tissue were gone etc. I thought maybe this is normal. When I went back to them for my regular appointment mc was handled like it was normal. I just keep trying. I didn’t think much of it . I did cry at home and this sub helped me to resume my life to normal. 

Fast toward a year later I was pregnant again this July. This time I waited till 6 weeks to see them. The same thing , doctor never saw me only a nurse and pee test. I expressed my anxiety but she just told me Awwwe it is common. I asked if I can get blood test to help my anxiety they said no not yet. They won’t see me till 9 week scan earliest. I tested everyday with extreme anxiety hoping for dye stealer. I never suffered so much anxiety. The day finally came went through the same procedure. Apparently the doctor I saw was a family doctor but my regular doctor. Either way she did ultra sound wasn’t sure what she saw. I knew sth was wrong and then she did vaginal. Then she called in another doctor and confirmed the empty sac. However they never told me how many months and how much measurement. She even mentioned it could be molar pregnancy and I need dc. I knew what molar was and compete could lead to chemo. Having my Mom gone through chemo and seeing her pass away caused even more anxiety. She was supportive in the sense of  caring and comforting but she didn’t say it was obligated ovum. She said she Dosen’t know what is wrong with my scan. I asked for testing she said they don’t do any till 3rd mc. She referred me to Swedish ogybn in Seattle ( biggest private hospital in Seattle ) they did my hgc level but never called me back. 

I had to wait for a week guys. Not knowing what the heck I have and what could possibly go wrong. The anxiety was even worse. I just wanted to get over with and move on. I still had horrible symptoms etc. a day later Sweedish called and fitted me in this Tuesday. I was so nervous I couldn’t sleep. 

My new og was extremely nice. She went through my history and I told her about my pervious mc and this one. At first she was confused why I was even sent there. Apparently my doctor didn’t document that ultrasound properly . She quickly squeezed me into radiology and wanted to make sure she gets an official scan this time. She went through my options with me and explained each. She treated my mc like it mattered. She tested me for blood type today and is doing hormone and hyroid test after my dc. She also offered potential genetic egg and sperm test and will speak to me about it after my dc. She comforted me and let me know she had 3 mc and she understands the pain. She said next time I would have my blood drawn and earlier scans etc. this is exactly what I wanted from the first doctor but was refused. She apologized that I had to wait up to a week to get this over with. I am having my dc this week finally. 

The saddest  part comes ... I went to ultrasound. My tech was really nice and she asked me why I was there etc. she also shared she had mc etc. they did the scan not even a min she told me it was small stopped at 5 week with belly but she sees no molar. They took lots of scan vaginal and belly. Then the doctor on site checked in with me and confirmed it was not molar and sent me my way. I am waiting for my new og to call back tomorrow to schedule my dc. 

The sac stopped at 5 week meaning if I gotten the us I requested earlier since I had anxiety I would have known already. The fact my doctor didn’t know what scans I had when the tech could even tell gave me so much anxiety. I am not going back to them. My husband was there with me twice the whole time. Even my husband said to not go back. When my husband I learned it was not molar and we both took a big breathe and was a lot happier. It is still sad for us but a lot better than what it could be. The staff are both supportive but the quality of care is just differential. I will be using this new og. My biggest mistake was not seeking for an ogybn I like but chose the one they just gave me.",t3_igq2y8

My partner left me completely and I lost a lot of friends as a result of our breakup too. We basically shared a friendship circle and he started dating someone else in our friend group within weeks of my miscarriage. I stopped getting invited to things because they would both be there.

The pain of ""missing my baby"" has eased but it feels like something I've had to suppress because nobody understood.

When I was pregnant nearly everyone in my life expected me to have an abortion, especially my ex. He told me he'd leave me if I didn't have an abortion (even though he ended up leaving me anyway when I miscarried). I ended up not even getting to make a choice myself. 

I just saw a tik tok of a girl close to my age (I'm 22) and it showed her ""rainbow baby"" and my heart just broke unexpectedly because I just feel like I never got that chance. I didn't have anybody to try again with. Having a baby was never an option for me, nobody understood that I felt any loss. My ex even said it was ""convenient"" that I was miscarrying.",t3_ig86qp

1127,Miscarriage,"First post here; I hope I follow the rules. I’m not looking for medical advice, just hoping to get some btdt stories to see if my suspicion is correct.

I was due to start my period on Saturday, which I did. (My period is pretty reliable, it will be off by a day or two occasionally.) I started cramping a full 5 days beforehand which was unusual. This is my fourth day of bleeding moderately heavily, when I usually have tapered off by now. I continued to have cramps and passed quite a lot of tissue in the shower today. I realize all of this is in the realm of normal for a period, but it’s quite unusual for me as my periods are typically shorter and not so heavy. 

Does this sound like a blighted ovum to anyone else? I wonder if taking a pregnancy test would show elevated hcg levels to sort of confirm?

Thanks for any advice or experiences you can share.",t3_igm6gy
1128,Miscarriage,"I had my first ultrasound at 7+2 yesterday and all my OB and I saw was an empty gestational sac. Unless I'm actually only 5 weeks (which seems nearly impossible), it's a blighted ovum. That is a result I didn't imagine. I knew there was a risk, but thought it'd be more along the lines of not detecting a heartbeat. The idea there was maybe never an embryo there is upsetting.

Now I have to make the choice many of you had to make...wait to miscarry naturally (but not more than two weeks), misoprostol/meds, or D&amp;C. I really don't know what to do. I haven't spotted at all so I don't count on my body figuring out what's going on in the next two weeks. I lean toward the D&amp;C but I'm afraid of the scarring. I know it's ""rare,"" but...miscarriages are also relatively ""rare"" to some people. I'm terrified of what the expectant management experience will be like and afraid of bleeding too much and going to the ER. My OB said I'm early enough that it probably won't be that bad, but she can't guarantee it, of course.

i go for my d&amp;c today, it’s almost 2:30 am and i need to be up soon to get ready and leave for the hospital. 

i have one more ultrasound before my procedure and i just want them to tell me this is all a mistake. that my baby bean is still alive and healthy, i don’t think the odds are in my favor. 

i cant stop crying, i fucking hate covid because i’m going to be alone in the hospital before and after my procedure. it’s not fair, this whole thing isn’t fair. i want my baby back so bad, i want to piece back my heart together but it’s shattered into so many pieces i don’t think it’ll ever happen.

i don’t even know what else to say, my mind is all over the place. i wish this was a nightmare i could wake up from. i don’t understand what i did to deserve this.

someone had the audacity to tell me the other day that bad things happen for a reason. what the fuck is the reason for this? how could there be any logical reason for this to happen to anyone? i’m so mad, i go for drives and scream and cry like a lunatic everyday. i want to feel something other than this sadness. i want people to leave me the fuck alone and stop making me feel bad for not answering their calls and texts. i know they mean well but give me some fucking space goddamnit. i’m sick of everyone accept my boyfriend. i’m sick of people trying to “cHeEr Me Up” with sick fucking miscarriage jokes. i’m not laughing, this will never be funny. it never has been funny. i would never wish this pain on anyone. i just want to rot in bed forever. i have no motivation to do anything. i just want to listen to sad music and fucking cry. why does can no one just let me be sad? what’s the point of asking what’s wrong? how do you not know what’s wrong?

1130,Miscarriage,"I lost my first ever pregnancy at 5 weeks on Sunday. I am fine some of the time, stoic, thinking we can try again- but then I just crash. Numb, self-loathing, fat and stupid, like the world has ended and the outside world hasn’t realised. 

The idea that I have to go back to temping, POAS, and leave all the pregnancy subreddits I’d joined... it makes me furious with myself. I’d been cautious the whole time I knew I was pregnant because I knew there was a risk. I’m furious with everyone who told me things would be fine, to stop testing, furious with the GP receptionist who told me I couldn’t speak to a doctor or midwife til 4 Sep, with every pregnant person I see. 

At 5 weeks I don’t feel like I have the right to grieve as much as people who lost theirs much later.

My husband told him that we likely would not be attending due to covid and trying to be extra careful with this new pregnancy. Well, two weeks ago I had my second MMC of this summer. This time at 8 weeks. We hadn’t told many people and very few family members. I have been in an awful funk since losing baby number 2. In an attempt to cheer me up, my husband took me to Disney world (my happy place!) this past week. Well, we just received this message from my husband’s cousin’s fiancé: 

“The below comments/statements are based on Jonathan telling me that he saw a picture of your family down at Disney recently. Jonathan and I completely understand that you and your wife were concerned about her health coming down for the wedding due to Covid. I think it’s pretty shitty that you guys are willing to come down to Florida and to to Disney, but not willing to come to Florida for a family members wedding.”

I am LIVID. First, they aren’t even close. IF we went to this wedding, we would be the only members from this side of the family attending. Second, I want to write this bitch back and say, “hi! Yeah so I was still gushing blood and passing pregnancy tissue and clots while on the toilet at Disney world. We’ll mail you your wedding gift.” 

And lastly, I’d like to add, I am a Travel Agent specializing in ONLY Disney travel... so it’s kind of my JOB to go during this strange time so that I can report back to my clients. 

My husband filled her in on what was going on- very nicely I may add, much to my disappointment. She has yet to respond. I hope she feels like a complete bitch. 

People just don’t really know what you are going through. And shit like this makes it worse. 

Thanks for letting me vent. Now I’m going to go change my pad and wipe away blood and send angry thoughts her way.",t3_ig2ixr
1132,Miscarriage,"I had a D&amp;C on 7/14 at 8 weeks for a pregnancy that stopped developing at 6w1d. I had some spotting for about a week afterwards which then stopped. On 8/6 I had 3 days of light-medium bleeding which I thought was a light period. I started to track ovulation about 10 days after that, but since my OPKs were positive and BBT seemed high, I took a HPT which was positive. On 8/18 my serum hCG was 60 and 48 hours later on 8/20 it was 52. My OB isn’t sure what’s going on - whether it was a chemical pregnancy after the D&amp;C, incomplete evacuation during the D&amp;C, or does it just take this long for my hCG to go to zero. He said since he doesn’t normally trend hCGs after a MC, he’s not entirely sure what the case is. He wants me to do weekly hCGs until I hit 0 and use condoms until then. Does anyone have experience or input with this? Any help is appreciated!",t3_igbe1u
1133,Miscarriage,"After miscarrying over two weeks ago I’m finally scheduled for my D&amp;C tomorrow. I’m terrified because I’m a big girl (5’4 and 280) and am afraid I will be turned away for some reason. When I get nervous my blood pressure sky rockets and I’m just so nervous. Have any other big girls had a D&amp;C? Did the doctors give you any trouble?

For reference my doctor tried to get me to have my miscarriage at home, but due to my history of heavy periods my husband and I are too afraid to have this happen. Also, I’m a teacher and have to come back to a school soon, so not knowing when he will pass is not an option.",t3_igdd12
1134,Miscarriage,"First pregnancy, first miscarriage. I found out last week that baby was 6w3d and sac was 8w1d. From there we did a 48 hr Hcg test, and found the levels to be dropping. 

Fast forward to today - baby has not grown and sac has shrunk slightly, never got visual of a heartbeat - declared a missed miscarriage.

I’ve been scheduled for an emergency D&amp;C during Hurricane Laura on Wednesday of this week. I’m slightly freaking out and just feeling overall anxious about the process, and a hurricane hitting the same day does not help this. I guess I’m just airing out my feelings and looking for support 🥺 I’ve been reading this sub since the first ultrasound and have found so much peace.",t3_ig1xfr

1136,Miscarriage,"In late April my boyfriend and I found out I was pregnant unexpectedly and we were really excited, we were a bit stressed because of COVID - not knowing who would be allowed at the birth, what dr appts would be like with me going alone, what the world was going to look like in 9 months etc - but otherwise really happy. We had names picked out, had just started a register at the request of our family, and had started planning a nursery. I went to my 8 week appointment by myself and as soon as I saw the drs face when she did my US, I knew something was up. She said I must’ve had my dates wrong but I knew I didn’t. She did bloodwork, which was not good, and my second US saw no additional development and a deflating sac. So we scheduled a D&amp;C since it was a missed miscarriage and the baby had not been developing for almost 4 weeks at that point. I’ve had 2 periods since (right back on schedule) and both of them have been very hard for me mentally. It just feels like a slap in the face. I can’t stop thinking about how far along I should be and everyone seems to be either announcing a pregnancy or a birth right now and it’s so hard to see. We’re not trying again at the moment because things with quarantine in CA have gone on much longer than we initially thought and my boyfriends still out of work and that also makes this feel even more unfair. I feel like I had already switched gears into mom mode and even if that baby was the size of a grain of rice, that was my baby and I miss him or her all the time. I never heard their heartbeat or found out the sex and all I have is a the sad ultrasound picture. I’m almost 3 months out and that’s longer than I was even pregnant for but I just can’t seem to let it go and it’s starting to feel a bit unhealthy. Not sure if I’m the only one here struggling with these feelings but it feels good to get it out",t3_ify6uy
1137,Miscarriage,"My friends have been trying to get pregnant for a few years.  The wife has miscarried 4 times now.  There's nothing she wants more than to be a biological mother, and each child lost is devastating.  She has a ritual where she takes photos of the fetus, buries them, and writes poems.  Her last one was very recent, and I'm trying to find a good way to be supportive beyond just, ""oh, I'm sorry, prayers and positive vibes,"" etc.,

Is it cathartic to talk about the IVF treatments or travel?  Future plans?  I'm trying to help, just not sure about the lines separating nosy, caring, and just quizzical.

1139,Miscarriage,"I had a MMC (blighted ovum) and had my d&amp;c on 7/7. From there, I went into the doc every other week for blood test to track my HCG. Those were 80K before my d&amp;c, 800 2 weeks after, 70 4 weeks after, and I don’t have my results yet for the 6 weeks one. I took a pregnancy test a couple days ago, and it looked negative. 

I bled lightly for about 3 weeks after my d&amp;c, and it stopped. Last Friday, I had spotting, thought it was the start of my period (yay!) But it went away after a day. Yesterday morning, the bleeding came back and was more consistent with a regular period... but went away yesterday afternoon. Before all this my cycle was 38 days and my period lasted 5-6 days.

1143,Miscarriage,"Sorry in advance for the gross topic, but I’m looking for some other experiences to compare to.

I recently had a MMC and D&amp;C at 8.5 weeks. I had absolutely no signs whatsoever that the pregnancy was not going well, and my body wasn’t giving any indications that I’d miscarry soon even after I knew for a week. The D&amp;C also went as smoothly as one could and I spotted for a few days afterwards.

Yesterday, I had a weird discharge that I’ve been wondering about because I had an identical type right before the procedure. It’s a light brown color, almost the consistency of CM except it kind of breaks up if you move it around. 

Before the miscarriage, I had various types of discharge that I could immediately google and deem to be not worrisome. But this discharge threw me then and it threw me now - is it tissue? Is it old blood? It’s not the type of dark brown color like at the end of a period, it’s lighter than that. 

Basically I’m wondering if this is bad news if it happens in a future pregnancy (assuming that ever happens........) or if it’s totally “fine.” If I actually did have a sign this time beforehand and just didn’t know enough to recognize it. When you’re passing tissue, is it really obvious that it’s not any kind of CM?",t3_ifrmey
1144,Miscarriage,"My miscarriage was six months ago. Saying that out loud seems so crazy. It feels like it’s been forever. I feel like I’ve been longing for my son for eternities. It feels like I’ve been trying again for so long. Something in my gut just tells me I’m not getting him back. 

I wanted to talk to my husband tonight so badly. Tried to get my thoughts together by asking myself why this is hurting me so badly today. I realized that it never stopped hurting. Looking back, I’m a completely different person and I didn’t even realize it. Days when I’m feeling okay, I still don’t act like I used to. My spark is gone. I don’t care what tomorrow brings. I don’t care about little adventures anymore. I’ve lost interest in everything that used to make me happy. It’s like I’ve just been wearing a mask for the past six months. 

I’ve never really been suicidal. My ocd gives me strange thoughts and in the back of my mind I always have this nagging fear that my body will do something and my mind won’t be able to stop it, but that’s as bad as it gets. I never act on these things. I wouldn’t have the guts to do anything. But I long for the relief of not waking up. And that’s so sad because my life is good. I have a husband that takes care of me. I have two sweet cats that I adore more than anything. My ocd is at a manageable level and I’m not struggling to keep it under control. I have a few really good friends that always keep me on my toes. Things aren’t bad at all. But all of the good things seem pointless. All I’ve ever wanted was a son. At this point, even a little baby girl would suffice. I just want to be a mother. That’s all I’ve ever wanted. I got a taste of it, and I think that’s why I’m so upset now. I was so close to my dream.

Today she told me that she was about to go to the hospital because of a lot of bleeding, that's about all that I know so far. I haven't heard from her since. This was almost 6 hours ago. 

How do I show support? I don't want to message her assuming the worst, but I also don't want to just ask how it went because that seems insensitive. Asking if she's okay also doesn't sit right with me, depending on what happened. She does have a support system in her boyfriend and his family, so she definitely has people around her caring for her, but I'm worried that besides them she doesn't have many close friends around here.

This is my first pregnancy, so even if you do feel like you would after a “normal” pregnancy, I have no clue what that is. I opted not to go for a D&amp;C, for some reason, for me, delivering him just felt like something I needed to do for myself and for him.

How was your body physically after laboring and delivering your baby? What kind of physical stuff did you go through after delivery? 

Did your vagina hurt afterwards for a while? 

How long after were you able to go back to your lives (work, going on walks, that kind of stuff), physically speaking?

1150,Miscarriage,"I had my first miscarriage in 2017 at eight weeks.  The baby was measuring a week behind at a seven week ultrasound, so I knew that the odds weren’t great that the pregnancy would last.  I started bleeding and cramping and my body was able to get rid of everything without medication or a D&amp;C.

I got pregnant in June this year at age 39 and the pregnancy seemed to be progressing normally.  I had a lot of nausea and fatigue, and my eight week ultrasound showed a baby measuring right on time with a strong heartbeat.  Last Monday, I started spotting.  Nothing too crazy, but I called my OB/GYN to let her know.  She had me come in for an ultrasound on Wednesday afternoon, at which point the spotting was continuing but hadn’t gotten any worse.  The ultrasound showed a baby measuring three days ahead and still with a strong heartbeat.  No reason for the spotting could be seen on the ultrasound, but the doctor was not concerned based on how well the baby seemed to be doing.

Fast forward to 4:00 am Thursday morning.  I was having some abdominal discomfort that was making it hard to sleep, but the pain wasn’t similar to what I experienced in my first miscarriage.  All of a sudden, I felt a gush of fluid so I got out of bed, turned on the light, and could see that I had bled heavily all over the bed and that my leggings, underwear, and overnight pad were soaked with blood.  I woke my husband up and ran to the toilet trying to understand what was happening.  I have pretty heavy periods, but I had never bled so much in such a short period of time before.  I put on a new pad, new underwear, and new pants and proceeded to bleed through those within a couple minutes.  At that point, I knew I was going to need to go to the ER to see what was going on, so I called the on call OB to let them know.  

I wrapped several towels around myself and continued bleeding heavily for the 15 minute drive to the hospital.  When I walked in, they could see how much I was bleeding and took me back immediately.  (My husband didn’t come in because we thought no visitors were allowed due to COVID-19 precautions.)

The nurse came in and helped me try to clean things up as much as possible.  She was so, so nice.  The bleeding kept going, so I got an IV and some blood work.  The doctor came in and asked me the standard questions and told me that, based on my pulse (80s) and blood pressure (120s over 80s), I was not going to bleed to death.  Up to that point, I had not passed any tissue, so the doctor wanted me to wait until 6:30 am for the ultrasound tech to come in.  

For the next two hours, I waited and hoped that somehow things were still okay with the baby.  I was told that my hematocrit was normal, so the bleeding shouldn’t concern me too much (yeah, right).  When I was taken up for the transvaginal ultrasound, it was extremely painful.  I couldn’t see the screen so I had no idea what was going on.

When I came back down to the ER, I was told I could have one visitor, so I let my husband know.  He had just shown up when the new shift doctor came in and told us that unfortunately, there was nothing in my uterus on the ultrasound.  He asked me if the previous doctor had done a pelvic exam, and I said no.  He told me that he would give my husband and I a few minutes and then if I was okay with it, he’d do a pelvic exam.  

My husband hugged me and we cried.  My immediate thought was disbelief - despite all of the bleeding, I had seen my baby ~12 hours before and it was doing just fine.  How could I have miscarried so suddenly?  It didn’t make sense to me.

The doctor came back in with a female nurse and explained to me that I was likely still bleeding because of retained tissue.  He began the pelvic exam by inserting a speculum, and I was in so much pain that he had to stop and give me a few minutes.  When he reinserted the speculum, I was able to breathe through it and it didn’t hurt as bad.  My husband held my hand for the next 20 minutes as the doctor alternately removed tissue and packed my vagina with gauze to try to soak up as much blood as possible.  He told me that he was able to remove the sac, the fetus, and at least part of the placenta, and that it would be sent off for testing to see if there was any obvious explanation for the loss.  He also explained that it was likely a chromosomal issue and that nothing I did caused it.   

My bleeding seemed to slow down, so I was told I could go home.  However, my blood pressure was a little low (100 over 55) and I had a very slight fever of 100 degrees, so they decided to keep me for another half hour or so for monitoring.  At that point, they allowed me to go but warned me about infection and hemorrhage.

Since I got home Thursday morning, I’ve continued to bleed what feels like a lot on top of the extreme bleeding I had before I went to the ER.  I fill an overnight pad every 2-3 hours and have passed numerous clots.  Tonight I passed what seemed to be more of the placenta, and I’m hoping that maybe that was the last of the tissue and the bleeding will slow down now.  

I’ve been going through all the possible reasons for the miscarriage in my head pretty much nonstop.  The most obvious cause would be a chromosomal issue due to my age.  But I wonder if all the wildfire smoke/air pollution we’re experiencing right now could have somehow damaged the pregnancy, or if some underlying condition I’m not aware of could have been the issue.  In addition to wondering about the reasons, I’ve been reliving my ER experience and wondering why the first doctor didn’t just do a pelvic exam when I got there, instead of making me wait for an ultrasound and then the results.  If the pelvic exam had been done, he could have seen right away that I was miscarrying.  

Anyway, thanks for listening to me share my story and vent.  I’m so sorry that all of us here have been in the same boat - it’s really shitty and unfair.  Hugs to you all.",t3_iezxm8

1155,Miscarriage,"Long story short, I took 3 pregnancy test and they came out negative after 2 months of late visits from Aunt Flo. A week after the last test i got my ""period"". I proceeded to bleed for almost 3 months. I bring this up now because recently I had the most INTENSE AND PAINFUL cramping with a lot of blood clots (one on day 2 in particular was bigger than anything I had ever passed) just yesterday. Its been 3 days of cramping with day 2 being the most painful one. Once I passed the big blood clot I noticed there was some greyish fluid in the blood clot and the cramping went from 11 outta 10 down to 4 outta 10. 

I had gone through multiple pads on day two (i changed about every 2 to 3 hours because of the bleeding) but today its the usual amount of time in between.

With all this being said, I am unsure if i did have a miscarrage or if its something else. It seems to check out but unfortunately I wont be able to speak with my Doctor until tomorrow.

I have posted quite a lot since my MMC. All of you are so wonderful and so helpful. It was my first miscarriage and anytime I have a question my doctors office is always closed. Plus I don’t want to continue rushing to the ER all the time. 
Tuesday I’ll be two weeks out from my d&amp;c, I’ve had some on and off bleeding, with very little cramps. The bleeding slowed and I now have a watery yellow discharge only when I wipe. (Never on my pad). It has no odor as far as I can tell, I don’t have pelvic pain or a fever. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I have tried to stay positive, I often times go into a completely panic over everything since all of this happened. I have a follow up tomorrow with my doctor however she won’t be in, it’s just an ultrasound and beta test. So I’m going to call in the morning to see if another doctor can do a pelvic exam just to be sure. But for now just curious if others experience.

The pain is constant but fluctuates in intensity. I went back to my doctor and had an ultrasound and tests done to try to figure out why I am in pain, all of which were negative.

1163,Miscarriage,"(marked as vent but not entirely sure this fits that category). i just wanted to share this because it's made me so emotional (in a good way lol). when i miscarried i was left totally without support, i'd just turned 21 and miscarriage wasn't something any of my friends could understand. i miscarried alone with misoprostol and ended up at the emergency room a few days later because my cramps were so severe still. in emergency i was told by a doctor that ""it's probably not an ectopic pregnancy"" even though i knew that because i'd *already miscarried* not to mention had three ultrasounds.

i was in such extreme physical and mental pain and wanted even just some sort of support service but there wasn't anything, no counselling and no follow up from the hospital. a week or so later because of my cramps again, i ended up back at the womens' hospital where people were giving birth and in labour and it was just an awful place to be after a miscarriage.

i'm so happy to have read about this - it's possible if this unit existed when i'd miscarried i wouldn't have qualified for a bed there, but i just think the societal acknowledgement of early pregnancy loss being something that requires specialised services is amazing, because i felt the lack of services so sorely and was very much left alone.

A few days ago she started experiencing bleeding which after speaking with her doctors we came to realize was a miscarriage.  I’m having a hard time keeping it together when I’m alone.  Around her I handle it well as I know she’s having her own experience and difficulties.  She’s wanting to get up and get back to her normal routine but is having a very difficult time finding the motivation to do anything right now as there’s this cloud hanging over us.  At times I feel guilty for being so broken as we have a child and so much to be grateful for but as soon as we learned she was pregnant you can’t help but start creating their little life and future in your minds.  I want to move on but at the same time feel guilty doing so.  There’s nothing that we could’ve done differently or can do now but it just feels wrong to move on.

In a way I want to but without this overwhelming feeling of heartbreak.  I’ve never been one for tattoos, but I’ve considered one for this moment.  I’m not sure if that would just upset my wife more seeing a constant reminder but I just never want to forget this baby.  We never got an ultrasound or anything to even hold on to.

1165,Miscarriage,I am in the midst of experiencing my second very early missed miscarriage (5 weeks 4 days at loss both times). I do have one living child which I am so thankful for and does give me hope. Really what I am wondering though is if it is time for me to see a specialist or do I just chock it up to bad luck (and shitty 2020). I would love to hear about other experiences after 2 miscarriages and of an intervention was needed to successfully carry to term.,t3_iej0lf
1166,Miscarriage,I just took misoprostol yesterday around 230 I started to get cramping and some blood by 630. Most of the blood I feel like ended up coming out in Little clots in the toilet. I still haven't gone through a pad of blood. My OB told me not to take the second dose unless I had no bleeding within 6-12 hours. Of course it's Saturday and the office is closed now I'm not sure am I supposed to take the second dose cause I'm not bleeding enough?,t3_iempsm

1169,Miscarriage,"i found out that i had a missed miscarriage on Thursday. i noticed just now that my boyfriend took the ultrasound pictures off of the fridge. i know he did this not knowing it would trigger my sadness, honestly i didn’t know it would either. i just cant stop staring at the empty space where those pictures were now. it’s really giving me a visual representation of how empty my heart feels without my bean. 

everything seems so meaningless now, my entire life i’ve wished on birthday candles, shooting stars, wish bones, eyelashes and those little puffball wish flowers to have a baby, and to be a mother. i feel like my baby was ripped from my arms even though i never had the chance to hold them.

1170,Miscarriage,"**Trigger warning: this is about miscarriage, but also mentions my living children. This may be upsetting to others but is necessary in talking about my loss.**

It's the second anniversary of losing my baby and I'm still angry at my mother, but I'm not allowed to express it because she made it all about her.

First loss was at 19, but that one I can reconcile because of the violent man I was at the time. Successful pregnancy would have tied me to him.

At 35 I gave birth to my first rainbow, who is now two and a half. When he was eight months old we decided to give him a sibling, and I got pregnant on the first try.

The eight-week scan showed a healthy, lively little treasure. That was August 22, 2018. It was also my parents' wedding anniversary, and Mum gave me hell because I picked up my oldest after the scan and told her the baby was healthy, but didn't say ""Happy Anniversary"".

She gave me hell for almost a full day. Abusive texts, abusive calls, coming to my house and yelling at me. More than once I told her I was worried about losing the baby if I got too stressed but she kept right on because the only thing she cared about was that I didn't say happy anniversary and was therefore the most selfish person in the world according to her, because ""even Facebook friends"" who were otherwise strangers had responded to her post with congratulations...

In the end a friend of mine yelled at her to leave me alone for the sake of the baby. She then turned her rage on that friend and abused her because ""it's nothing to do with you, you don'tget to tellmehow to talktomy daughter!"" My friend didn't mind, she said that at least my mother was leaving me alone now.

Two weeks later, September 9, I started bleeding. I went to the hospital and was ridiculed as being a worry wart, so I went to the doctor the next day. He was angry at how I'd been treated and got me in immediately for a scan.

The baby was still there, but they were dead. Growth comparisons showed that they died within 24 hours of the previous scan, August 22.

I was livid and told my mother outright that she had killed my baby, but was forced to take it back by my family because ""she's suicidal because you accused her"". I was not allowed to talk about the loss because ""Mum is depressed and we're worried about her"".

I went through the D&amp;C without family support, and damn near lost my mind.

The first anniversary I was camping with my parents. I was pregnant again, four months along, and Mum had pulled her head in. She said she was worried I'd accuse her again if I lost this one too. I said that she would only be blamed if she gave me a reason to blame her, so she was being careful not to give me a reason.

This camping trip was part of that. I love camping so we took my then 15-month-old son and went camping. The trip was awesome, except for the 22nd. I started crying and she said, 
""You're not going to ruin every one of my anniversaries now, are you?"" I told her that if my grief ruined her anniversary then yes, I would be ruining every anniversary because it was also the anniversary of my loss.

She didn't like it but she shut up about it and gave me a hug instead.

My pregnancy went to term and I now have two beautiful boys, but this anniversary I'm conflicted; I'm grieving for the lost baby, but I wouldn't have my second son who I love dearly if that baby had gone to term (he was conceived on what would have been the due date).

But I can't talk to anyone about it.

(I lost another on December 12, 2018, but I'm allowed to talk about that one because it doesn't conflict with Mum at all).

I am staying away from Mum today. I don't want to hear about her anniversary.

1173,Miscarriage,"So as I’ve posted before, we found out at 16.5 weeks Wednesday that our little boy didn’t have heart beat. I’m going in to the hospital on Sunday to labor/deliver him.

I am a nanny, I took this  whole coming week off of work, as I took the rest of last week of too after I found out the news. My boss has been SO understanding but she’s kind of acting like she wants me to come in the following week, so the week of the 31st. I’m taking this coming week off to physically heal, and I will be in the hospital until Tuesday.   

She’s had a miscarriage too, hers was a in the first trimester. I think she’s kind of comparing her situation to mine and when she went back to work. She’s a very sturdy woman and really loves her job.  Compared to her I feel like I’m being a baby. I only work for her 2 days a week, as my little nanny boy started preschool this year.  I think I’ll be feeling up to it.. but my husband and I also just wanted to take a week or at least 4 days and go to Colorado to just decompress and kind of fully get over what just happened. Is 2.5 weeks too much time off of work? 

Should I just snap back to reality and forget Colorado? Is it selfish of me to want to enjoy myself before diving back into work? (I’ll be working at a daycare the other part of the time when I’m not nannying, the daycare is telling me take as much time as I need).",t3_ieivrr

She does this a minimum of once a day but sometimes up to 3-5 per day and then of course texts in between.

All I can seem to do is cry.. go on the Internet for a bit, listen to some music, fall asleep, repeat. I play music and make art as well.. but I just can’t concentrate or really bring myself to even sing.. my brain just feels like it has forgotten everything and is just going in circles. I can’t even focus on watching tv for very long. Is this just what the grieving process is for some? I’ve never been through anything like this in my life.

1179,Miscarriage,"Hi Ladies, 

I had a miscarriage on August 18th. I had a lot of blood loss. Three days later, I am still bleeding, having pain on my lower back and stomach and soft black masses come out. I was wondering if this is normal or how was your experience after. I am a anxious person and I don’t know if I should back to the ER or Urgent care.

I found out i was pregnant on July 18th, i missed my period. It was a sigh of relief, happiness and all the good feelings that come with being pregnant. I took as a sign that God gave me purpose now as I had tried to take my life back in May. As soon as i found out, I went to my doctor to make sure I was okay and my baby too. Everything checked out but, the one concerning this said was there is no heartbeat. Went to go get a second opinion, same results. They said because I was too early on in the pregnancy understandable but, what threw me off is both offices said different information. First, i was 6 weeks, then 2 months, then 6 weeks again. I knew something was wrong when each time there was no heart beat. Exactly a month later, Agustus 18th. I felt pain, then blood. I was rushed to the hospital. Hospital was going to make me wait until I bled all over there floor. The rest was history, I knew that exact moment. My baby was gone. They did their standards procedure and come to find out I was actually 14 weeks pregnant. I am just confused, upset, mad at myself and my body. I had my period in June. I had no pregnancy symptoms nothing. I’m fustrated because I feel the doctors knew something was not okay. I just feel emptiness in me. Someone that I can’t get back. My purpose is gone. It makes me sad, to see my partner is more emotionally affected by this than me. He is usually not emotional. I am but, right now I am. Numb to the core. I am in pain. I feel betrayed. I just.

1183,Miscarriage,"Yesterday I found out that I'll be having my 5th miscarriage, my 4th this year. This time felt different in every way - great betas with high HCG, an embryo measuring well last week with a good heartbeat. And yet 6 days later, there was little growth and no heartbeat. Sitting in that room alone (thanks Covid), I swear I didn't even want to deal with it this time. It took all I had not to just scream ""forget this"" and walk out of the doctor's office. I had some light spotting throughout, so I shouldn't be surprised, but I hadn't experienced that in any previous pregnancies. Not only did this pregnancy feel different in that I was the most hopeful I've ever been (I thought NO WAY this could happen to me again), but now I also feel more broken than I've ever felt.

Endless tests, and the doctors have found absolutely nothing wrong with my husband or myself. It finally occurred to me that we'll probably never know why this has happened to us, and we'll probably never have our own kids. Or kids at all. I know that ultimately we'll be okay, and we'll both make it through this, but right now even getting out of bed feels like the biggest chore.

1187,Miscarriage,"After agonizing over DNC versus medicated miscarriage, I finally chose the medicated miscarriage route with misoprostol after the failure of our first IVF fresh transfer at 9 weeks of gestation. The nurses at my clinic didn't provide me guidance and left me confused, hence I am hoping for some help here. 
I took Misoprostol yesterday (4 tablets vaginally) and within an hour I had contractions. I bled for about 8-9 hours and passed large clots and something that felt solid (husband collected the clots for taking to the lab for testing). After about 9-10 hours at 2 am, bleeding and contractions stopped. 
Today I have very light bleeding ( like the last day of a regular period). 
 The nurse told me that some women only get mild cramping and some bleeding from the first dose, so they are asked to take it again the next day. I, on the other hand, bled straight for 9 hours, so I am assuming I am done.
The nurse further said that they would ask me to take a home pregnancy test 3 weeks from now to confirm whether there was any HCG in my body. 
Do I need to take more misoprostol or am I done?

1189,Miscarriage,"Sorry this is going to be a very jumbled mess, my brain is in a fog. 

Hello,
So I was pregnant with my first baby, we found out at 12 weeks he was going to have an omphalocele. There was a chance he wouldn’t make it to term, but I put it in my mind that he would. We grieved for that, but moved on to hope. 

Yesterday at 16.5 weeks I went to my appointment for a check up only to find they couldn’t find a heart beat. I will be induced and deliver.. hopefully ASAP, as it makes me sad to carry around our dead baby. Calling my doctor today, she gave us a day to grieve and talk about what we wanted to do. 


At first I said to the doctor that this was a relief, so the baby didn’t have to suffer with his medical condition he would have been born with, and it still is in a fucked up way.. but I’m starting to realize that that was just my freaked out brain talking. I’m so sad that I’ll never get to meet my first baby alive. For some reason I feel embarrassed, like I didn’t do my job, I feel like I failed my baby. I don’t know how to address the over whelming amount of people constantly asking how my pregnancy is going. My SIL is due at the same time as I’d be due, we were pregnancy buddies.. it’s just going to be hard. I know things will get better. I know I have to be strong and carry on.. how did you do it? I just feel so overwhelmed and weirdly confused right now. I feel like it’s a big deal, but I feel like others don’t feel it is.. I’m not sure why.. no one has said anything to me about it not being a big deal.. my brain is just a fucked up mess right now. Going to therapy today.. so that should be good.

1190,Miscarriage,"I’m going to be 35 this weekend.  I had a D&amp;C on Aug 5 after my 12 week appointment the previous day showed my baby had no heartbeat. 

This morning was my follow up.  I was so hoping the doctor would say nothing hugely abnormal was seen and that I was clear to start trying again. 

Well, she said as far as the baby goes, that was the case.  However, the pathologist noted that there was some overgrowth of the placenta.  While not cancer or precancer, they do want to monitor me a little bit more closely. 

I work in oncology education so my heart sank immediately.  I am familiar with gestational trophoblastic disease.  The doctor was quick to reassure me that that is not what they’re seeing at this point but it’s still another source of anxiety that leaves me feeling like I can’t move on.  I just feel like I have the worst luck.   

I have been having some nausea for the past few days and she seemed especially interested in that.  I have done a couple of HPTs and have seen my levels going down so that had been a small comfort but now I’m worried that it might go back up. 

I got some blood work done today and she wants me to get HCG at least once a week, possibly twice a week to monitor how things progress. 

She was firm on no sex for at least 4 weeks following the D&amp;C and no strenuous exercise for that long as well.  She said once I reach 4 weeks then we can have sex with a condom until I get my first period at which point we are free to try again but that is provided the bloodwork comes back okay. 

I’m just so frustrated feeling like things are delayed and what if I can never have a child?  I see other people on here where their doctor told them they’re fine to have sex and start trying one to two weeks after their D&amp;C.

1196,Miscarriage,"Hello.
I've been scrolling and commenting on this thread for a few weeks, so some of you may already know my story. But I figured it would help myself and possibly others to get it all out. Sorry for the length.




Our first pregnancy ended in a MMC she stopped growing at 9 weeks, and my body wouldn't let her go until 13 weeks. Once it started, I went through 12+ hours of intense contractions and blood that increased throughout the night. I woke up late and rushed to the toilet. Heard my water pop and everything fell out. I yelled for my boyfriend. He didn't wake up. I was too much of a coward to dig through the contents and find my baby, so Lily got flushed down the toilet 😭 I made a dreamcatcher on her due date and spent over half a year being angry at the world before feeling a bit better.



Got pregnant with baby #2 in April. Got a doppler and heard a strong heartbeat since 9 weeks. I had been spotting since about 9 weeks and was diagnosed with a small SCH and put on modified rest at 11.5weeks. I continued to spot up until my 15 week appointment. The ultrasound showed the SCH had cleared up, they weren't sure why I was bleeding. But I had noticeably low amniotic fluid. My baby boy was all scrunched up in a little ball on the screen. 



The doctor put me on rest and said to increase fluids and come back in a week. That whole day I leaked amniotic fluid. That night i dreamt I miscarried. I knew it was fluid and called the midwife early the next morning. She assured me its super rare to have waters rupture at 15 weeks and was likely my discharge and lube from the visit. I knew she was wrong but also knew the hospital wouldn't do anything anyways so stayed home. 

This is where it gets graphic. 


That night at around 11pm i started cramping. But it was pretty light. Not even as bad as a period and nothing like my first miscarriage. It started to concern me so I went to go shower. I sat on the toilet and felt something enter my birth canal. I reached down and his little foot was sticking out of my vagina. I yelled for my boyfriend and told him the babys coming out. He immediately helped and was beyond supportive and we birthed our son in the next 20 minutes while holding eachother and bawling. I held his body in my hand the whole time. Once his head was out, he moved in my hands for half a minute. Then he was gone. My placenta wasn't coming out, so we cut the cord. 


My boyfriend helped me wash him clean.  We got a beautiful jewelry box he bought me from Oregon and laid our son in there on one of his onesies. We surrounded him with gems and crystals and a turquoise stone for his big sisters birthday so she could be with him too. We cleansed his body with sage. We told him how perfect he was and how loved he was.I watched my boyfriend turn into a Daddy the moment he saw his son. He gave him so much love and gentleness. He debated the destination of our babies souls. He decided Baby Jese would want to be buried. 


The funeral home came to take him the next evening. Jese walked his boy out to the car and gently wrapped his box in a blanket in the back seat and kissed him goodbye. We held eachother and cried and talked about all our lost hopes for our babies. We went 4 days later to bury our son. My placenta refused to leave my body until the day of the funeral. I bled so bad during his ceremony I had to go to the bathroom and change pads before walking his tiny casket to his grave site. I wasnt sure I would be able to read the letter I wrote to my babies, but I proudly did. I said my goodbyes. 


Two days later my milk came in. I had no idea it would happen. I woke up with rock hard breasts. I expressed enough to make into a necklace. I am 5 weeks post partum and my breasts still leak for a baby to be fed. I buy flowers every other day to put on my babys grave. He is next to 2 other babies who don't have a headstone or receive flowers so we make sure to leave them flowers too. 

This experience has completely changed our lives. I cannot even begin to express or truly process the trauma this has caused for us. But it has also brought us so much closer as a couple. Its made me a better person. A better mother. I now know the insignificance of most life issues. I understand true pain and loss and the fragility of this life we live. I know i am not special and don't get any special treatment from the world. I am just as likely for heartache as the next person. I know that I am a Mother. I birthed my son and held his tiny perfect body in my hands and put him in the earth. That shit is eternal. Regardless of future earthside children. I am Jese and Lilys Mommy, and nothing will ever change that.

I'm a 16 (nearly 17) year old transgender man (female to male, no hormones or surgeries yet) and I'm in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend. Earlier this month I went to Florida to visit him as we'd planned it earlier this year before the outbreak and we couldn't go back on it now. I had just gotten on birth control pills back in late July (Mono-linyah) and we'd gotten intimate multiple times a day for five days straight which obviously is just asking for trouble but we were too stupid and caught in the moment to realize. A few weeks go by to today and I thought I finally got my period after it had been extremely late and texted my boyfriend to have a mini celebration. So I went about my day assuming I was happily not pregnant and our reckless behavior didn't get us into any trouble. I was at the store doing some grocery shopping when suddenly I felt such an intense cramp I wanted to keel over then and there in the middle of food city. I also felt my period suddenly get extremely heavy and I bled through my tampon and could feel it going down my leg so I wrapped up my shopping as quick as I could and after sulking in my car for a bit from the intense pain and nausea I finally got home and went to change my tampon only to notice a large fleshy mass in my underwear. It almost looked like a tongue with some stringy bits of bloody flesh attached to it and what appeared to be a tiny, thin white cord. I knew this wasn't a clot of blood. It was way too big (fit the palm of my hand) and it had too many features and textures to it. So in a panic I called my boyfriend in almost tears to tell him I think I had a miscarriage. He told me there was no way that was possible because the time between us having our first intercourse and today was too short for anything to have developed but after reluctantly showing him we agreed that there was no other explanation given the anatomy of what was sitting before us. We have very conservative family and know that if they found out about this they'd probably never let us see each other ever again or at the very least trust us and they'd lose respect for us individually as their children so we agreed to never tell another soul about it, flush the remains and move on as best we could and learn a lesson from what we did. Of course we could never afford a pregnancy nor are we physically or emotionally capable to raise a child given our living and financial situations and the fact we have big plans for our futures that we couldn't achieve with a baby (he just turned 19 earlier this year and again, I'm almost 17 with my birthday around the corner) and even if I found out I was pregnant later on, because of the taboo of abortion around here and the fact my dad is extremely pro-life I'd induce a miscarriage however I could since an abortion isn't accessible to me. But despite that I was saddened by the miscarriage. Was it a blessing in disguise? Yes. Did I want a baby and would I still want it after I found out about my pregnancy? No, not at all. But despite that I felt an emotional attachment to the glob of flesh that I stared at for 10 minutes with tears in my eyes. I feel like I just lost a loved one and I feel metaphorically and quite literally empty inside. I'm in so much emotional turmoil right now. I'm agitated, sad, angry, anxious and all around exhausted. I have nobody to go to to talk about this because its such a personal experience and if it got out I'd never see my boyfriend ever again and my parents would be disgusted with me and their opinion on me would change forever so I decided to come here for support. I didn't want this potential baby but I still feel so attached to it and despite knowing this is a gruesome blessing in disguise, I feel guilty, shocked and horribly sad and angry with myself and the world around me. I don't know what to do. Every time I step into my own bathroom where it happened I feel dread and I'm pretty sure this incident is now a trauma for me but I don't know how to handle it. Especially all by myself with nobody but my boyfriend to talk about it to. I know I made stupid decisions that led to this and I regret them, I can't help but feel guilt for it and it's hard enough posting this but I don't think I'll get better any other way. Thank you for reading this incredibly long post and any support or advice at all would be so very appreciated and helpful to my emotional and physical recovery, thank you.",t3_id814b
1198,Miscarriage,"I’m currently still going through my miscarriage, feels like forever now, but it’s been two weeks of ongoing bleeding. My husband never wanted kids, he always swore he would never have any. He also always said he wouldn’t get married. Well, here we are married almost a year, and trying for a baby. He was so nervous while we were trying, kept trying to put it off by saying we should take a trip to Cedar Point. We got pregnant, of course we couldn’t plan that trip then, he was SO excited about the baby, we miscarried, it really hurt him. So I’m planning my vacation time from work, October is our first wedding anniversary and I told him maybe we can go to cedar point then? He said but we might be pregnant then! It crushed me. Absolutely crushed me. He’s SO hopeful for the next. I don’t believe for a minute we will be pregnant then. At this rate I feel like I’m never gonna stop bleeding. Plus now I’m terrified the next pregnancy isn’t going to stick. Or even happen. It hurts that I was the one so excited for kids, knew that being a mother was what I was meant to do, and my husband was so scared to take the leap, and now we’ve definitely reversed roles. He’s so ready and hopeful and I don’t think I can even let myself get attached to the next pregnancy until I know for sure things are okay.",t3_id157w
1199,Miscarriage,"So I am on vacation with a couple and apparently before the vacation they got terrible news that their baby could have a problem and she could miscarriage or the baby could die in Labour.
She is devastated and I don’t really know how to help her. 
I told her that I am here for her, if she needs someone to talk to. She sad she doesn’t want to talk. Was that ok? To offer? 
I am feeling a bit lost in how to react. I don’t want her to think I don’t care. 
But I don’t want to pressure her either.
We are not very close.

1200,Miscarriage,"So, I had my first pregnancy end in miscarriage at 6.5 weeks back in March. Pregnancy was not really on my radar right now being that I’m 25 and still in school. But now, the longing for a baby is intense. Even though my OB I saw when I lost my baby said everything looks fine, I want to get tested/checked and see a doctor for my fertility to make sure I’m doing what I can to better my chances. Do you guys know any questions that I should ask the doctor?",t3_idako8
1201,Miscarriage,"I am posting this again with modifications. Last time it got deleted by a moderator for no explanation. This made me feel super rejected on top of feeling horribly depressed.  :( 

I am 36, started trying in january. (Possibly got pregnant in January but never made it to the test.) I got pregnant in February during the Covid-19 lockdown.  I postponed going to the doctor until I was 8 weeks along. Only emergency doctors were working. I went for what I thought would be a routine first confirmation of pregnancy but it turned out to be a missed miscarriage at 7 weeks 3 days (i.e. still felt pregnant but no heartbeat). I was so shocked. I could barely do the necessary tasks - give blood, wait, go back to office, etc. I just felt so shocked and empty. I had the medical abortion at home but in such a way that I had to hide that anything was out of the ordinary.

It was horrible both physically and mentally. I could barely walk from sheer exhaustion. There is no preparation for it really. The doctor was also not particularly sympathetic, but at least she could explain all the details very well and calmly, asking if I understood and repeating when necessary. I also was not an easy patient and I wasn't trying to be. I had a short rant about why is subclinical hypothoidism so often ignored when it is so necessary for the development of a baby. I take T4 substitute and I had my levels checked that day - it wasn't very low. I don't know what caused the miscarriage but as a biologist I know it was probably just a chromosomal error. I was working from home and my colleagues had no idea that during a web meeting I was barely holding back tears.

I waited the demanded ""2 normal periods"" before trying again just as the doctor instructed. On the first try, I got pregnant again. I read statistics how rare it is for a woman to have more than one miscarriage. Also, I haven't found the numbers but it seems like most miscarriages are bloody with cramping, not sneaky and silent. I waited until 6 weeks, then I got antsy about getting an Ultrasound to check the vitals. I was told I should make an appointment with a midwife for around 8 weeks, so I did. For weeks I walked around being pregnant and not being pregnant at the same time. The thought ""maybe it's dead!"" often popped into my head and I just shook my head that this is so unlikely. The pregnancy symptoms grew, tummy was showing, breasts got bigger. The midwife had me wait more then 15 min over time so I was already quite on edge when I walked in and rambled about why I'm there. She took me to the ultrasound and checked for heartbeat. None! She sent me for a second check. I was just saying ""no way, this can't be happening, this just can't be happening. Not again!"". The second ultrasound confirmed the result. I had had a second silent miscarriage at 7 weeks and 3 days (then corrected to 7+4).

This last part happened yesterday. I'm still coming to terms with what happened. Even though I knew nothing was certain, I was really expecting this one to be a keeper. I had already ""sacrificed"" to the merciless ""god"" of Probability. This one was supposed to be the proof that I was just being paranoid to worry so much. When the first time felt like an unfortunate tragedy, this one feels so brutally unfair. How can this be happening to me?! I already had this happen once and that was enough to meet the statistics!

As a result I am deeply depressed. Suddenly nothing makes sense. Nothing has a meaning. Those forest berries I froze thinking ""it's also healthy during pregnancy"" feel so pointless I just want to throw them out. That work-related thing I was going to finish before maternity leave - so pointless. And I just hate my body. I hate the pregnancy boobs, I hate that tummy. I just keep tucking it in, even slapping it to make it disappear. I considered exercising just to punish my body to look less pregnant. I went to work today. Cried in the car and kept quiet but I don't think no one noticed much difference. I walked past a mirror and just felt hatred for what I saw. That traitor who can't make it to 8 weeks! 

I will have the medical abortion on Friday and a doctor's appointment in a few weeks to try to find out what went wrong and what to do differently the next time.",t3_ictljp
1202,Miscarriage,"I had my d&amp;e for my first pregnancy/mmc last Tuesday. On Thursday, my husband and I drove several hours to visit his family for the weekend (planned pre-miscarriage). This was also supposed to be the weekend we told everyone we were expecting. I felt like it wasn’t a great idea to go after the procedure but convinced myself it’d help but I regret it deeply. 

My husband’s family is not warm &amp; fuzzy like mine, but they’re good, caring people. Their support for what we’re going through was not obvious. He told them all beforehand what happened and when we were there for the weekend, his sisters didn’t directly acknowledge the miscarriage or even ask me how I was, it was as if everything was normal (one of them is a mother herself, I thought she’d at least say something). I had a minor panic attack after some friends of their family were invited inside the house (no masks, covid concerns, everyone except me was tipsy or drunk, guards down). I spent the rest of the night crying and venting to my husband, I was absolutely miserable and insisted we leave as early as possible the next day. I felt safe and at peace once we were home &amp; alone, but since this past weekend I’ve been crying off and on.

On top of this, my cousin is expecting and we were excited to be pregnant at the same time and that our kids would be close like us. We joked about it being a pact before I knew I miscarried. She’s on her way to having a healthy pregnancy and I’m sitting here empty after losing mine. It feels so cruel and unfair and I’m terrified to even try again because I can’t imagine having to go through another miscarriage. I go from wanting to try ASAP to not wanting to try again at all. I don’t know how to cope with these feelings and just feel so alone, I know I’m not though in this community.",t3_id0z64
1203,Miscarriage," I miscarried nearly 6 weeks ago at around 7 weeks and I seem to be having signs of a first period but it’s extremely light and barely there. I feel like this can’t be marked as an actual period because I have read many testimonials on reddit about a heavy and painful period so I’m not sure what this is? Also, the blood of my ""period"" is so dark and does not fill a sanitary pad. I feel confused so please only comment on people who have gone through a period like the one I described. Thank you.",t3_id3kpl
1204,Miscarriage,I found out last week that I’m having my second miscarriage in four months. My first was a MMC in May. The baby stopped growing at six weeks. This one was a blighted ovum.

1207,Miscarriage,"Hi all. Anyone who has had a chemical before remember how long it took your positive tests to stop/bleeding to start? The lines on my tests started getting fainter four days ago but are still visible. Honestly at this point I just want my period to come so I can have a sense of finality with this.

ETA: Looks like I should have just waited a little longer—having some spotting this morning that I am sure will turn into my period at some point today. Thank you for your responses!",t3_icyto0
1208,Miscarriage,"I found out at my 12 week scan on August 4 that my baby had no heartbeat and had died the previous week.  I had a D&amp;C the next day. 

Before my surgery I asked if they would be doing any tests to check for abnormalities or anything and was told no, just basic tests (whatever that means). 

I haven’t gotten any lab results back from anything that was done on the day of the miscarriage so I guess I’ll get those results tomorrow. 

I have seen all sorts of things from people on this subreddit and others so I don’t know what is normal.  Stuff like getting an ultrasound, pelvic exam, getting bloodwork to see where the HCG levels are, etc.  

I’m only supposed to be seeing the doctor, AFAIK. The ultrasounds and bloodwork are done in another office on that floor.  

I plan to see what she tells me and ask if: 

1. We can resume having sex already (I was told 4 weeks no sex and no exercise!) 
 2. If I can get a copy and email of the baby’s last ultrasound picture.  
3. If they did tests to find out the sex (that was supposed to be done at the 12 week appt but that all went out the window when there was no heartbeat.)


Other than that, my mind is just drawing a blank.  I guess I’m just fearing the worst and that I’ll be told there is something wrong with me and that it’s unlikely that I’ll ever carry a baby to term.  Plus, I’m going to be 35 this weekend and I’m afraid I’m running out of time even if that isn’t the case.",t3_icz2cg

1210,Miscarriage,This morning I woke up at 4:30 with a little bit of cramping and the feeling of needing to pee and I touched my lower belly as if to say good morning little buddy and noticed my panties felt wet and thought I had peed myself in the night and when I went to go to the bathroom it was a huge fish of blood along with a fairly large clot (probably close to the size of my fist). I called the ob office and got the midwife on call and she said it could be a subchorionic hematoma and I could be fine. I’m getting bloodwork done this afternoon and an ultrasound tomorrow but I’m just so nervous. This is my first pregnancy and I’ve been worried about everything since my positive test.,t3_icos8f
1211,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my experience and just vent, I guess. I feel really depressed and it's hard to talk to friends about it when a lot of them are pregnant or have children.

I had a chemical pregnancy (\~4-5 weeks) back in June. The experience was brief and strange because I had only coincidentally found out I was pregnant a day before I started miscarrying, and hadn't expected it since I had what I thought was a heavy period about a week before.

Honestly, I had no idea how traumatic and stressful a miscarriage would be prior to this experience. I always knew that miscarriages were common, and that it was really painful to go through, but I really just.. had no idea how emotionally difficult it would be. I'm sure you know what I mean.

I actually got pregnant again before getting a period after the miscarriage. I'll always remember the faint line, seeing the heartbeat for the first time, and showing the ultrasound to my husband. But the entire time I was pregnant, I was filled with so much anxiety and stress. I constantly worried about miscarrying and thought about it all the time. I analyzed every possible symptom and freaked out because I never had many severe symptoms. Looking back, I actually wish I hadn't worried so much and just enjoyed the pregnancy, as brief as it was. I remember reading this exact sentiment on a lot of other posts, but I don't think I fully understood until it was too late. My thought process before was, if I enjoy the pregnancy and it ends badly, then I'm going to regret enjoying it. But now, I regret not enjoying it while I could, and just feeling stressed the whole time.

With this second pregnancy, I saw a heartbeat at the 6 week mark, and again last week at the 8.5 week mark. Last week at the ultrasound, I was worried because I started spotting, and asked my OB for progesterone levels. She ordered it along with other prenatal labs (thyroid, diabetes, etc) and the progesterone came back really low. So for the last few days, I couldn't even be reassured of the heartbeat and the baby growing because I was so worried about my progesterone. I was started on suppositories, but it was too late. 

I came back today for another viability scan and there was no heartbeat. I'll always remember my OB's disappointed face, and seeing the baby on the screen with no more flickering.

She talked to me for a long time about workup for recurrent miscarriages. I'm thankful she's willing to order all the labs for me even though typically providers only order it after 3 miscarriages. I'm scheduled for a D&amp;C next week, since I haven't passed anything yet. I'm terrified of starting the miscarriage at home and of the pain and seeing the sac/baby. I was ""lucky"" that I had a very early miscarriage last time, so physically it wasn't too bad, and now I'm terrified of what will happen with this one.

I'm terrified of not being able to carry a child to term. I'm otherwise seemingly healthy (31 years old, no health conditions, at a healthy weight, exercise regularly, decent diet). Aside from the workup the OB will order, I don't know if I should bother with taking supplements and changing my diet for egg quality. Certainly I have nothing against it, but I don't know if changing my diet and cutting out a lot of things I enjoy would make a difference.

Thank you for reading.",t3_icb7qr
1212,Miscarriage,"I’m 5 weeks post D&amp;C. The first two weeks were rough. Depression creeped in. I hated my body. The bloat and pregnancy effects took time to go away. Every time I saw myself in the mirror I was reminded how my body wasn’t providing for a baby anymore. I started focusing on cleaning the house. It kept my mind busy. I starting working out and dieting in an effort to combat my depression. After 3 weeks I was doing ok. Though I felt guilty for not being more sad. Got my period at 4 weeks. I was tremendously happy. I was just glad my body was becoming back to normal. 

But last night I received a package from my mom. She sent me a plush and card. The card was addressed to our “future” baby. I was so hoping she meant our lost baby. But nope. She was talking about our next one. I know she meant well. It was a kind and sweet gesture. My mom and I have been estranged for years (my choice) and she’s just now coming back into my life. She’s been great with this MC. I did thank her for the gift. I hid the plush and card in a closet. Told my husband. However I have been so depressed and sad today. 

I’m not promised another baby or one that doesn’t miscarry. I don’t want to get my hopes up. I am scared if we get preg again. I’m afraid all this will repeat. I wish I could go back to when I didn’t know the pain of losing my baby. I miss my baby so much. I want to move on but I don’t want to forget. Remembering is so hard though.

1213,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone, so I was 5 weeks pregnant and went through a miscarriage last night. This is my second miscarriage in a row. Does anyone have experience with back to back miscarriages?

Just want to get some insight I guess, thank you",t3_icg1bu
1214,Miscarriage,"I can’t believe I’m writing this but here I am. I was 11 weeks 6 days when I found out four days ago that I had a missed miscarriage. I was just a day away from sharing the news. I had planned to tell a few of my closest friends the day after I helped host one of their virtual baby showers. Instead I silently suffered on Zoom while multiple women swapped current pregnancy stories. Of course I’m excited for my friend, but I thought our babies would be six months apart. Now I’m not sure what’s next. 

We saw a heartbeat at 7 weeks 5 days so this turn of events was completely unexpected. My doctor believes the heartbeat stopped at 8 weeks 3 days. I was supposed to schedule my D&amp;C this week but yesterday I started to bleed and have intense period-like cramps. I googled natural miscarriage and learned what I was feeling was normal. I called my doctors office and the on-call doc warned me I would be in for a rough night. He told me to collect any tissue I passed in a ziplock bag, put it in my freezer, so they could test it later for abnormalities. About an hour after that call the pain quadrupled. I was drenched in sweat, vomited twice, my hands became tingly and I started to hyperventilate (the nurse said the last two symptoms were anxiety). My husband rushed me to ER, I felt delirious and was having what I now know is contractions. 

I’m so fortunate I was able to go to ER. They gave me two doses of Morphine then two doses of a stronger pain med and the cramps were still 10/10 on that ridiculous emoji pain chart they have in every room. I was bleeding a little and my cervix was still closed so they called my doc to do an emergency D&amp;C at 4 a.m.

The anesthesiologist made me take five deep breaths and 45 minutes later I was in the recovery room. Now I’m back home after a painless surgery. I am very thankful for all the compassionate medical professionals who helped me. Thanks to Covid I was in the hospital alone, without my husband by my side. But everyone was wonderful. 

I feel some relief and closure now that my uterus is empty. The hardest part was breaking the news to our parents. I’m 35 and this would have been my parents first grandchild. My husband’s family is overseas and, like us, they were so excited. We had names picked out. My stepmom already started buying toys. I had made so many plans, surprised my husband with a Manchester United onesie and now the onesie, all the belly oils and sweatpants I bought are tucked in the back of the closet. I’m trying really hard not to give up hope. Honestly, I think I was more attached to the idea of the future than the baby, the pregnancy still felt surreal, but now I’ve never wanted to have a child more than I do now. This sucks but reading your stories has helped a lot. Thank you and God bless.",t3_ic6nmu
1215,Miscarriage,"Hey everyone.
A week ago I had a miscarriage at 20 weeks, my first pregnancy and my first miscarriage. We went to the anatomy scan at the hospital and found out our loved one didn't have a heartbeat. It was such a shock because we thought everything was perfect, nothing had been wrong and we're both young and healthy. We were so excited and happy for this baby. I went through labor and gave birth to our son last Wednesday (we didn't know the gender until he was born). He was beautiful and we got to take pictures of him and say good bye to him at the hospital. Something I will always cherish. 
The thing is I can't stop blaming myself for what happened and I feel so guilty. Was is because I drank three cups of coffee or because I took a few sips of beer?? I'm more anxious then I used to be and I'm afraid I'll never be able to give birth to a living child. Something I never thought I would worry about. I'm meeting with my doctor after 5 weeks to go through what happened (if they can find out) and it's hard for me to think about anything else. I also feel very alone as I don't know anyone who's also been through miscarriage in the second trimester.
Is there someone here who has a similar experience and is willing to share it? It would help me a lot.

1216,Miscarriage,"I found out that I was pregnant on 8/6/20. My husband and I have been trying since I got my tubal reversal in 2017. A friend of mine had gotten her tubal reversal in 2017 as well and she and her husband welcomed their 3rd son 12/31/18. I was so so ecstatic for them, and all I could think was “we’re next!”. After two additional years if trying I settled and told myself that if it didn’t happen it would be ok and that we would just adopt of foster ( I was a foster kid) because they are still “your baby”. That was in June of this year. August was like... it’s your bday month so YOU’RE pregnant!  

Today I was  6wks, today I also think that I’ve miscarried. I’d been having a kind of light brown discharge (tmi sorry) for about 2wks. Around an hour ago  it felt like a “gas pain” pretty light. But then I felt moisture and ran into the bathroom. There were 2 huge clots. My panties had a lot of the brown discharge with some pink. I’m going to the doctor tomorrow. Is there anyway that it’s NOT over??

I don’t know how to feel I just want to know if anyone else had something like this happen and if it was a miscarriage or not. How did you feel? What was the out come in the long run? Did you get pregnant after? Was it not a miscarriage at all?

1217,Miscarriage,"Yesterday I went to the er. I knew light spotting was normal but this was different. 

I went to the er because I was cramping and bleeding small clots. 

I sat on the toilet for 30 minutes in absolute shock at what had just happened. 

“Not this one, this was supposed to be the one I held in my arms.”

I couldn’t cry. I couldn’t speak. This has happened before. This one felt different though and I feel guilty for thinking that way. 

The front desk lady was pregnant. Very pregnant. I cried. I couldn’t stop crying. My boyfriend cried too, but he had to check me in. 

This was a crappy hospital. My bed sheets were stained with somebody else’s blood and the private gyn bathroom had blood stains on the floor and the door handle. I was living in a nightmare. 

The doctor gave me false hope. “Lots of women have full blown periods when pregnant, just wait and see what happens.”

I was willing to believe even the worst doctor because I wanted my baby in my arms. I was being selfish. 

This morning I woke up and I knew it was over. I went to the bathroom and didn’t move for 2 hours. It hurt physically and mentally. It didn’t hurt emotionally, I was so numb I couldn’t cry. 

We went to my obgyn and she told me what I needed to hear. 

Had the baby come out the way I wanted then they may not have been healthy. 

Nothing about my pregnancy was normal and the only doctor to have to balls to tell me saved my mental sanity. 

I lost my second baby today and nothing feels real. 

I know who I’m meant to be. 

I’m meant to be a mother. Whether it be through conception, or adoption, I will be a mother. 

I will pick up every piece of who I am everyday and move forward. I will tell my story and remember I’m not alone. 

You’re not alone. 

Maybe we can never be fully repaired, however we can be broken together to make a whole.

My husband doesn't seem to understand why I don't want to try to get pregnant again immediately. He said we can wait 2 or 3 months but need to keep trying again soon.

I'm not on contraceptives. I had an IUD before the pregnancy, but I've asked my husband to use condoms on my fertile days now.

Strangely, I also have absolutely no desire to masturbate. My appetite for sex with my husband is normal though. Anyone else felt like this?",t3_ic0y6v
1219,Miscarriage,"90% sure I'm going through miscarriage #2.
We got pregnant when I ovulated this month.

First positive test on Sunday (15dpo).  Didn't expect it to say positive. I honestly thought it would say negative and calm my mind so that my period could start.  I wasn't as excited this time around, but I can't completely turn off my optimistic tendencies.
Yesterday at 16dpo at hcg was 44.9 ~ not too horrible but on the low end for sure (lowest possible is 33).  No word yet on my progesterone level, but I suspect it's low.  I take another blood test tomorrow... and I doubt my number (hcg) will double like it's supposed to.  

This morning I took an at-home test and the line didn't get darker... it's supposed to get darker everyday.

I've spent most of the last four hours crying. I don't anticipate doing much more than crying/sleeping/meetings-for-work for the rest of the week.  
I don't entirely understand or know what I'm feeling.  I'm not numb, so that's a good thing?  But I sort of wish I was.

I know it was unrealistic to hope that this pregnancy would be viable... but I so wanted that to be the case.

I got pregnant two months in a row.  The odds of that happening is astronomical.  I won't be this lucky in the future.  What if it doesn't happen again for months/or years/ or even ever?

What if I've wasted all my luck on these two, precious little masses of cells that ultimately amount to nothing?

My husband is so supportive and wonderful and I'm so thankful for him.  I wouldn't want to go through this with anyone else.  But dammit I wish we could be real parents.",t3_ic6qms
1220,Miscarriage,"I had a D&amp;E almost a month ago. I was 22 weeks 💔 

Has anyone’s period returned yet after a D&amp;C or D&amp;E? How long did it take for it to return and was it like your normal period or very different bleeding/symptoms?

Sorry for all of you going through this physical and emotional clusterfuck.",t3_ic4gip
1221,Miscarriage,"I’m sure like many others, I frantically googled everything when I realised what was most likely happening. There was quite a lot of information but honestly nothing really applied to me. I wish people talked about this more. So here is my experience.

I’m 30, and in a long term relationship. I got pregnant whilst on the pill. I was very excited and nervous. I had a dating scan and was declared to be 7 weeks and 3 days along. The technician noted that the sac was small and would need to be monitored and my doctor would most likely book me in for a scan next week. I noticed that the heart rate was low. I don’t know a great deal about pregnancies or babies, but I am addicted to medical and emergency shows. The heart was 60, and I knew that was really low. 

The technician didn’t say anything, and I knew she couldn’t really, so I didn’t ask her anything. My partner was there, and he was so happy.

He noticed I was upset as we left, and asked me why. I  said I was pretty sure the pregnancy wasn’t viable. He told me to think positive and wait and see. I nodded and went to work, but I knew. I knew from right there it was done.

I spoke to my doctor who said she’d seen babies come back from this and babies that hadn’t. She scheduled me for an ultrasound in a weeks time and told me to contact them if there was bleeding or severe pain.

5 days later, in the evening, I started bleeding.  I didn’t tell my partner, I don’t know why. I called nurse on call who told me to see a doctor within 7 hours. I live in a regional area, and that meant going to emergency. I decided to call my doctor in the morning instead. 

I called my doctor in the morning, and went to see her an hour later. She sent me for an ultrasound. At this point I told my partner, who was very sweet to me. 

He met me at the clinic and we went in together. I had a transvaginal ultrasound which confirmed no heartbeat. I cried briefly here. My partner hugged me and said how sorry he was. This experience has made me see him in a new light. He isn’t an emotive guy, it doesn’t come naturally to him, but he supported me the whole way through.

I cried hard on the way home, like I probably shouldn’t have been driving. I have not cried since, and it’s been about 3 weeks. I’ve been sort of numb, emotionally. I guess my brain is protecting me? 

I saw my doctor the next day. Here’s where I don’t think things were dealt with very well. I was told to go to the emergency room if the bleeding was using one super pad an hour for a few hours, or if the pain became unbearable. I nodded and went on my way. 

I had cramping and passed “old blood” and clots for the following few days. Then on the Saturday, 3 days after the ultrasound, the pain really hit. I started bleeding bright red blood and passing large clots. The pain was severe. I couldn’t think, I had to take all my clothes off and essentially felt like I needed to poop but nothing came of that. My friends have since advised me this is what early labor is like. It lasted about 12 hours. My partner wanted me to go to hospital, but for some reason I decided I wasn’t hospital worthy. Brains are weird. That shit HURT, I’ve never hurt that much. But I couldn’t quite decide my pain was “unbearable”. I spent the night in a ball in the bathroom clutching a heat pack to my belly, vomiting, and showering as the hot water eased the pain in my lower back. Hindsight says that was a hospital situation. 

The next day I felt like I’d been punched repetitively in the belly, and as though I had the worst hangover of my life. And let me tell you, I’ve been hungover more than I should’ve been. 

The bleeding took another week or so to stop after that. I had another transvaginal ultrasound which confirmed no “matter” left. No follow up doctors appointments followed, so I assume I’m good to go. I’m afraid I’m not entirely impressed with that, but I suppose they’re all very busy with the added stress of Covid in an under resourced regional area.

I think I started grieving from the moment I saw that low heartbeat. By the time it hit I think I’d steeled myself for it. I didn’t know if at some point it’ll whack me upside the head or not. I’m just going with the flow. I’m not blaming myself, I’m not feeling anything really. I had no idea it would be so painful, physically. For that I was completely unprepared. My bearable and yours may be two completely different things. 

The reality of pregnancies, miscarriages and fertility isn’t something women seem to be made fully aware of until we’re in the thick of it. It’s sort of glossed over and glamorised. The likelihood of miscarriage isn’t well known. I wonder if this will ever be addressed.

1223,Miscarriage,"Hi all who are reading! I had an early miscarriage that started July 24th. I have been bleeding since then (24 days) it’s been fairly light, sometimes I wear a tampon, others it’s just panty liners. My HCG has been dropping for 2 weeks (345 to 75 as of 08/27) I am still passing little pieces of tissue. I had a vaginal ultrasound to rule out ectopic (my HCG fluctuated a bit) and the doctors said my uterine lining didn’t appear thick or anything. Is bleeding this long normal? Could I possibly bleed into my next period??",t3_ic73ny
1224,Miscarriage,"On 4/3 I had some light pink spotting, doctors weren’t worried. On 4/5 at 5 weeks I had a gush of red blood, and then have continued with red blood since then. Some days no blood, some days only one wipe of blood, other days all day. Never enough to get on a pad, only when I wiped. But it’s been almost every single day that I have some bit of bleeding. Then on Saturday I felt like I needed to poop (sorry, only way I can describe it) went to the bathroom and started passing clots (one that I REALLY think was the embryo/egg/sac/whatever it was at that point). I only passed a couple clots, but the cramps felt so severe. Went to the hospital, my numbers were not doubling. By the time I got to the hospital the cramps had stopped, they lasted maybe 30 minutes to an hour. Next day I had some tissue pass, but no cramps. Next day barely any bleeding, but I had severe cramps again. They lasted about two hours. And today no bleeding but I’ve got a bit of a dull ache. Is it normal to bleed for so long before the miscarriage? And is it normal for so little to pass out? My numbers never got super high so I don’t think I actually developed to 6w3d. I got an ultrasound yesterday morning but I’m still waiting to hear any results from that. The way my OB has treated me so far I wouldn’t be surprised is she doesn’t wait to give me any information until my “8 week scan” she scheduled on the 25th.",t3_ic3k8h
1225,Miscarriage,"Hi all, I am exactly a week out from my d&amp;amp;c, after MMC. Before my surgery my HCG was 33,000. This past Saturday it was 1,480. I had no bleeding and no cramping for the first 3 days. Saturday started spotting with some light cramps, same thing into Sunday. Yesterday and today however the bleeding has seemed to pick up. I’m not soaking a pad by any means. But when I use the bathroom for example, the toilet is red and there are small clots. I don’t have much cramping at all. Just curious to hear if this has happened to anyone, and for how long? My gyno said light spotting was to be expected however she never called me back yesterday (not shocked). Any insight would be awesome! Thanks :)",t3_ic3ajk
1226,Miscarriage,"So on Saturday I had a blood test for other reasons and surprise! My blood had 32hcg levels, now based on when I last had sex I’d be 6-7 weeks pregnant (sex 5 weeks ago and should be 1000+hcg), I had another blood test today but I’m just god awful at waiting, I also have peed on sticks which have come up negative, had a “period” just over a week ago, and I am spotting today (I don’t usually spot in between periods) I can’t imagine with the evidence I’ve had that this isn’t a miscarriage, is there any way a pregnancy could be viable with this low level of HCG? I’ve spoken to my doctors and they’ve been very vague and unhelpful and have basically just said “wait for your second blood test results” and I know none of you guys can know for sure but if you have your own experiences etc. in a similar situation",t3_ic0fcg
1227,Miscarriage,"I experienced my first MC in July at 6+4. I have been relatively ok, I keep telling myself it was the best kind of MC... early and natural and to get straight back on the horse TTC. So I started tracking my ovulation from day 8. I have a 37 day cycle which feels like forever!! I finally made it to my ovulation date and nothing.... I got all the signs including some egg white discharge! But nothing... I feel so defeated. I know my body will regulate but I just wanted to treat the miscarriage as a period and was hoping everything would work as normal so I could be pregnant again. 
Anyway, this is just a vent. Everyone just keeps telling me to be patient which I understand of course but I can’t help but feel sad and wish the first one just worked out. Maybe I won’t ovulate at all and I’m wasting my time. 💔",t3_ibwjjy
1228,Miscarriage,"A close friend of mine is coming up on the third anniversary of the miscarriage of her first baby.

I found her something personal I want to give her in memory of that baby, but I am unsure of etiquette. 

There is a place to add a few words of my choosing on the gift, I think I am going to write something along the lines of 'so loved' on it. Would it be acceptable to also put the due date or the month of the loss on it? Is one of those generally more appropriate?

1229,Miscarriage,"So yesterday I got my first period after a 7 week miscarriage and an hour later the midwife phoned for some pre appointment questions. I should of cancelled before but I just couldn't cope. 
On top if that I had work, I work for the emergency services so I've worked all through everything thats happened and it's been awful. 

I get home at 1am last night and there was a wrapped gift on my bedside table, it was a homemade something from one of my best friends to make me feel better and a lovely little note. She had dropped it off with my husband while I was working. I'm so glad I had already told her I was pregnant because I don't think I would of had the strength to tell her I'd miscarried before she knew there was even a chance.

1230,Miscarriage,"Hi ! Never thought I would post here again. This subreddit has helped me a lot and probably
Made the news a lot easier to bare from my doctor. 

A year ago around my bday I had my first pregnancy. I was so happy with my husband since I lost my mom to cancer not that long ago and I can finally  have another family. I was really naive etc and told everyone right after doctor confirms it with pee test at 5 and half weeks. They booked my ultra sound. Then right before my husband bday just two days after confirmation I had light blood and then heavy periods. This was my first miscarriage  I felt so sad that I just stay home the whole week and watched tv. Eventually I got over it and moved on with my life. 

After half a year of tracking cycle etc we gave up. My husband was exhausted and Covid came in so we stop tracking. Again I swear the exact same time this year I conceived. I had my pregnancy  line test 3 weeks. I tested because I was going to drink on my bday. Then the lines progressed very well I had dye stealer etc. I tested my self everyday to make sure I was positive even after doctor confirmed all the way to week 9. I checked for blood every time I feel like I have ptsd. I had all the pregnancy symptoms this time. I wanted to vomit I had pimple, sore breast sense of smell, exhaustion etc. I was so happy to go to my week 9 first us. The doctor was really nice and at first she couldn’t find anything other than tissues. So she went from belly us to vaginal. Then she was really quiet and I knew. I was having ptsd all over again. She asked if I could wait because she wanted 2nd opinion. Another og came in and checked. They went outside for a long time while I got dressed. She came back and said sorry. She was very supportive and tried to explain my sac was empty they think it could be molar pregnancy. At first she said I had 3 options come back a week for us again , d/c or pill option. Then the 2nd doctor rushes over and told her I need to get d/c and giving me false hope she knows if she was me she can’t sleep at night. She also wanted to get test done on the tissue? 

Then my eyes started to get watery. I wanted to cry but I tried to keep it together so I can ask her questions. Personally I was worried about the future if this will affect me and my fertility. She said so far she Dosen’t think so. She said I am young ( 28) and they won’t do testing till 3rd mc. They are referring me to another doctor to have procedure done within a week. I had to get my blood test to check hgc now I am just waiting. She was very supportive and I asked if next time I can come in way earlier for us to ease my anxiety since it is the 2nd mc. She promised me to see me at week 5 and half or 6 next time and hopefully to see me soon. I asked her can I finally drink wine and eat sushi she said yes. 


I got my blood drawn and went to grab sushi and wine. I am just glad my husband was there the whole time. But as I got home reality hit me even harder and I started crying non stop. I don’t know if I will ever get over the anxiety if I ever get pregnant again",t3_ibm5bh
1231,Miscarriage,Tomorrow is the day I have my D&amp;C after finding out we lost our baby last Monday. Yesterday I only cried a little after crying everyday multiple times. The anxiety I feel is unlike anything I’ve felt before. We are so hopeful to try again and have success but I am also terrified. How am I going to be able to be excited or happy next time without feeling guilty? I am so ready for this to be over so we can heal or attempt to do so.,t3_ibqd0u
1232,Miscarriage,"I finally realised that I can talk about this, one year on, and this is my story.

I had a miscarriage at the end of last year. I didn’t know I was pregnant until I was 5 weeks, and I was so excited, I spent the next few weeks planning exciting reveals to immediate family, parents and in-laws. I started planning a future. I was filled with so much joy. But low and behold, it wasn’t meant to be. At 10 weeks I had an early scan just to check everything was okay, because I spotted some abnormal signs. I was told by the nurse I was threatening to miscarry. Now, threatening to miscarry means that your body might not carry the pregnancy to full term. MIGHT being the key word. Which meant there was some hope, but also some chance that it may not. That was the first cracked line in my vision for the future for this baby. I went home in tears, my husband speechless, trying to digest this information so he could comfort me. I spent the next 2 weeks going into work, putting on a brave face, coming home crying, trying to hold onto some hope that things might be OK,. The hospital’s instructions were to call them if I noticed any change in the signs. And the signs got worse. I called them up, they called me in, sent me in for an emergency scan. I couldn’t keep my head straight. As you are having your scan, it’s not like a blood test, where you find your results out after, the nurse/doctor is watching the screen in real time, telling you what they see. While I am lying there, I am being told that they cannot find a heartbeat, the baby is too small for how many weeks pregnant I am. I am being told my diagnosis, that my body has silently miscarried. My vision shattered. I felt numb, but for someone so numb, I felt a lot of pain, hurt and sadness. So a week ago, when I was pregnant, holding out onto some hope of this baby surviving, I am now on a hospital bed, not pregnant, with no baby, feeling like a failure, furious with my self and my body, empty, unsure of what to tell those I had delivered the news too. Now us women have this silly little rule that “you should not be telling anyone you are expecting until at least 12 weeks, or had your first scan” And I cannot reiterate how much I think that is utter bullshit. You are not acknowledging your pregnancy and taking it serious PROPERLY after your 12th week, you and this baby have this connection from the moment the sperm meets the egg. So this stupid 12-week rule is bollocks in my opinion.

What followed this, was no walk in the park. I spent so long in negative mindsets. Firstly, I was upset and I blamed my self, I was furious at my self, at my body. I felt like a faliure I felt like it was my fault it went wrong. I wasn’t well informed of miscarriages, I didn’t know anyone that had ever had one. Following this I went into feelings of embarrassment, I was ashamed of my body, I didn’t trust it. I was second guessing everything my body did. I hated what I saw in the mirror. I became quiet, and a recluse. I felt as if I should get over it already, rush the grieving and healing procedure, focus my mind else where. But I was wrong. I should have talked about it, I hid it away like it was a dirty little secret, and forced my self to rush my grieving process. Why? Why did I do this? Firstly, because I felt bad for my partner for watch me mope about, he had been amazing throughout this whole thing. I had almost forgotten that he was going through this too. Secondly, family around me, even though I had a great support network around me, and none of them rushed me through this, they all were patient with me, but I would convince my self that I needed to speed this process up. I was my own worst enemy, and third, because talking about a miscarriage is uncommon, people don’t talk about it because societies have labled it as taboo. Yes it is a private matter, but that doesn’t mean you should treat it like a dirty little secret. Miscarriage is one of the most traumatic, sad, unhappy, filled of mixed emotion experiences someone will go through, but to act like it had never happened to not talk about it like it ever happened, to refuse to acknowledge it because people simply don’t talk about it is insane. Until I went through my miscarriage, I didn’t know that some of the closest people to me had also gone through one also. ‘Why didn’t I know about this?’ I asked? ‘Because people don’t talk about it, it’s just not something you do.’ 

I cannot tell you how much this answer infuriated me. Why? Why can’t you talk about it? Why isn’t it acknowledged? The amount of women who suffer from depression or PTSD or some form of stress or anxiety disorder, after the fact, is too immense for people to keep quiet about miscarriages! Talking about it would help women and men go through the process, maybe they would realise that they are not alone, and that they are not in the small minority of people it happens to, in fact it is far more common than they know! Talking about it openly, acknowledging it, may help save someone from going through depression, or being diagnosed with a traumatic stress disorder. 

I thought keeping quiet about it was a natural thing to do. I thought it was the right thing to do. It has been bred into me that talking about something like this is awkward and considered inappropriate. But that mentality of thinking is wrong. I can never wish for anyone who unfortunately goes through something like this in life to feel as if they have to go through this in silence. You are not alone, you are not bound to keep quiet, and for the sake of your self, please talk about it. I urge you to share your story for the sake of your own mental health, because the effect it can have on you if you don’t is so damaging. 

Do not forget that you even though you are feeling all these things, remember that your partner is also going through this as well, compassion works both ways - so please extend it to each other. Do no suffer alone! This is for all the people who have been through this in silence, you shouldn’t have had too, we are all human, our hearts beat the same, we bleed the same, we hurt the same, but we don’t have to do it alone.",t3_ibi08r
1233,Miscarriage,"I just need to vent. 
A month ago, I lost my baby boy at 15 weeks and it was and is still very traumatic for me and my boyfriend. This is our second loss, we have no living children. 
My very best friend since birth (our dad's have been best friends since they were 4) knows I am struggling very badly and she often checks in on me, im regularly sending her photos of flowers on my baby's grave/paintings ive done etc. 
Anyways, she posted this stupid post on Facebook. It said something like 
""Whats a baby name you loved but never ended up using?"" 
And i just fell apart. Lily and Jese would have been my babies names. I loved those names. I loved those babies. I didnt end up using those names, or getting to keep my babies. 
I just am so hurt. At the loneliness we probably all feel at times. At knowing that she doesn't understand. Knowing she doesn't mean it. But being so fucking mad that she was so thoughtless. And mad at myself for getting so worked up over somebody else's post, knowing I damn well have no right to determine what people can or cannot do or say or post. Its just sucks to be so misunderstood, to be surrounded by people trying to comfort and help but none of them knowing how and unintentionally hurting me anyways. 
It sucks that a stupid Facebook post can tear my heart out so instantly. I so wish we all had our babies. I want my damn babies. 
Thanks for listening to my rant.",t3_ibu1sc
1234,Miscarriage,"Hi, I'm losing my mind here &amp; could definitely use some help. So on August 11th I took 4 pregnancy tests, all came back positive. My breasts were sore, I was starting to feel a little woozy in the mornings. Great! Exciting! I scheduled my first prenatal appointment for the 27th which was when I was due to be 8 weeks. 

On this previous Friday I had light spotting and cramps, which then turned into dark brown discharge and my pregnancy symptoms going away &amp; now I'm experiencing clotting and heavy period blood. (TMI/TW) but today I passed the largest clot during this whole experience. I'd say it was about the size of my thumb. All of my pregnancy symptoms have vanished, my boobs are no longer sore, I don't feel sick in the mornings, etc. 

Today I went to the OBGYN to get everything checked out. I left with more questions than answers, and it was a very upsetting experience. I had to be alone due to covid-19, and I felt like my doctor wasn't very interested in hearing what I was dealing with. He asked very vague questions and gave vague answers. I had an ultrasound done, and obviously there was no heartbeat because I'm only 5 weeks4days. There was a gestational sac, but I'm still very concerned. He took my levels &amp; told me to come back on Thursday and that they should be doubled by then and if not then we will go about a route to make sure the miscarriage is safe. 

I am just feeling very lost, and wondering if anyone went to the doctor &amp; left with no clear answers. But still knew in their heart that they were experiencing a miscarriage. I just can't shake the vanishing of my pregnancy symptoms, the amount of blood and cramping I'm experiencing &amp; just the feeling that this pregnancy is not going to make it. :(",t3_ibo3qs
1235,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone. 2 weeks ago, I had to have an emergency D&amp;C due to no more heartbeat and 4 weeks of no growth. I should have been 12 weeks at that time but only measured 8/8.5 weeks. Prior to surgery, my HcG level was just over 120,000 which made the OBGYN concerned about molar pregnancy/cancer. They sent the remains to pathology which came back negative for molar. I just took a at home pregnancy test 2w/2d later and it's still showing pregnant.. Does anyone have experience with a high level of HcG prior to miscarriage and if so, how long did it take to come to 0? My OBGYN said to call her and go for a blood test after 2 weeks so I'm trying to do that but thought to also see what other's experience was. Thank you in advance!",t3_ibijy6
1236,Miscarriage,"Hello everyone. Starting at 5 weeks pregnant I started bleeding lightly usually red blood, usually just when I wipe. ER kept checking my HCG and it was doubling, and then at 6w3d I started having severe cramps and clots.went to ER, drew blood again and my numbers had gone up but not even doubled over four days. So we knew I was losing it. The next day I didn’t have bad cramps, and just a little spotting. Today I tried to go to work this morning but got hit with severe cramps again and had to leave. Had an appointment at the hospital for more blood work and a transvaginal ultrasound (my tilted uterus made a normal ultrasound too difficult to read) to confirm the loss and make sure everything’s coming out. My question is, how do you deal with the pain? I can’t keep missing work, but it doubles me over with a stabbing pain on my right side. I almost feel like I could puke from pain. If I go home and sleep or lay down for a long time it’s fine. And it seems to have no rhyme or reason. I thought it was the walking but I walked through target today and was fine. I could really use any advice. This is all so new to me. And I’m terrified I’m going to need to get everything removed from inside since I’m still barely bleeding.

1237,Miscarriage,"I'm 25 and lost my baby girl at the beginning of this year at 10 weeks (got an early blood test), my due date was 7/28, so obviously July was very emotional for my hubby and me. 

One of my friends, Jessica (fake name) was really supportive of me when I miscarried, she got me a spa care package and was there to listen to me vent. I haven't been able to see Jessica since March due to the lockdowns and work schedules (she works more evening/night shifts).  When July started approaching I became more upset and withdrawn, Jessica tried cheering me up with some texts and snaps, but I either ignored them or barely responded, and looking back at the texts I was a bit mean and short. By the time my due date arrived it had been over a month since Jessica and I had any real conversation, when we would normally call each other at least 2 times a week and talk to each other. Jessica didn't say anything to me on my due date and I was furious, earlier this month I had a few drinks (I was buzzed, not drunk) I sent her a message calling her a terrible friend. She tried explaining herself but I didn't want to hear it and I haven't talked to her in almost 2 weeks now because I'm embarrassed about how I acted. We've been friends for almost 10 years and i'm pissed that she didnt say anything to me, was I right in feeling this way or should I have handled it another way? Would therapy help with this? She's suppose to get engaged around Christmas time this year (Her boyfriend asked me for some help a few months ago) and she said that I would be her matron of honor, but now I may not help her in the wedding at all. Has a miscarriage effected anyone else's friendships? Is there any returning from this?",t3_ibn05h
1238,Miscarriage,"Being of advanced maternal age, I thought I had avoided many of the issues with pregnancy announcements, etc, than I know some of you have had to deal with. It has been hard enough to deal with without that and I know it must be hard for you to deal with these things. My issue was slightly different.

My boyfriend and I went to see his family and friends. I have seen one friend (the father of the child) many times, but this time there was the mother and also the daughter (who I had never seen. She is 3). 

As soon as I got into the restaurant, (even though I was told the child would be there and asked if I was ok with that, I said ok, because I have also met with other friends of his and their little boy and been fine) I knew it was going to be tough. This little girl was everything I hoped my own daughter would be. Beautiful, clever, funny. She wanted to play with me and it was like a knife in my heart. She showed me everything in her handbag. I didn't know what to say. Lots of 'enthusiastic' Wow!'s ensued. I struggled through the whole evening.

The following day, we were meeting the father of the child for a drink, and we went to his house because he offered us a lift into town, but it was a ruse to let my boyfriend meet up with other friends who were there.  Yay! Another chance to bond with the daughter and dress her doll and see the new things in her new handbag. Newsflash: I don't want to play with your daughter! The child's father knows I had a MC and I don't know if the mother knows, but I know she also had a MC before her living child, so I don't know if I would have had them do lots of bonding with my daughter had the situation been reversed.

Last night we saw other friends and I had a panic attack because they are a couple and for 3 (as it turned out, false) reasons, I thought, She's going to announce she's pregnant. I wanted to run away, and I spent the first courses of the meal in terror, because I had to act happy for her and I couldn't. Of course, she didn't announce that, and so I probably looked rude and like I didn't want to be there.

MC has so many layers to the grief - I never knew how hard it would be. Hugs to everyone dealing with the same. ♥️",t3_ibd345
1239,Miscarriage,"Tomorrow marks two months since we found out that I miscarried our son.

Over the past week I’ve started to develop some of the symptoms that I had early in my pregnancy before I’d found out I was pregnant. I’m tired almost all the time, my entire body aches, my appetite fluctuates towards the ‘not so hungry’ side and I’ve had a little bit of weird definitely not period cramping cramping. Today I found myself nauseous with no cause for the first time since I left my first trimester.

None of these things are normal PMS indicators for me so now I’m wondering if it’s possible I might be pregnant again. It’s been just over four weeks since I completely passed the tissue my body was holding onto and my cycles have always been a little irregular which makes it more frustrating.

I know some women do conceive before having their first period after miscarriage so I bought the hcg test strips so I can test tomorrow. I also know it can take longer for your cycle to get back on track and that it’s possible that I haven’t even ovulated but knowing that doesn’t change the feeling in my gut that I need to double check.

I know I want to actively try for another child, but I also know that I’m going to potentially have an anxiety ridden pregnancy because I got to 20w3d thinking everything was healthy and fine until suddenly it wasn’t. My husband and I have discussed and agreed we don’t necessarily want to *heavily delay* trying but that doesn’t mean I was prepared to test to soon.

Thanks for reading this far if you have... I’m just not sure where I’m at mentally with all this because I was just starting to wrap my mind around going back to working in person instead of from home. But it was nice to write it out anyway.",t3_ibmrfv

1241,Miscarriage,"I miscarried in June and it was a whole ordeal. Only symptom was cramping during my 6 weeks of pregnancy, and I also had a feeling it wasn’t going to take. ER thought I was having an ectopic and had to be taken in for an MRI, and I work in medical and knew the attending doc and radiologist reading my scans. So that was kinda of a blessing in a weird comforting way. So any ways.... today I found out via FaceTime that my husbands younger brother and wife are pregnant. I was super shocked by their announcement, but shouldn’t be. They ended up finding out right when I MC and didn’t share the news until 11 week mark. I don’t know why, but this freaking hurt. Like I was trying to hard to keep it together and not cry on the call. I’m truly happy for them but also super jealous. After this MC I’ve been having my hair fall out more and been trying to be very proactive. Like I’ve talked to all my friends about it and my bff also MC around the same time. I just can’t be happy for them really. Like I’m sooooo jealous and hurt that they’re having the first grandchild and not us. I know this is VERY selfish thinking of me but I can’t help it. Like I’m comparing our life’s to theirs and it’s not healthy. I want them to have a lovely and enjoyable pregnancy but I have this resentment over it. It feels better typing it out because I know in my rational mind I wouldn’t be like this, but I’m just so hurt and I haven’t really grieved since early June. My husband is also upset because he feels like I wouldn’t act this way to my brother and wife, and too be honest I wouldn’t. And I know it’s because we have a closer relationship and they reached out to us during our difficult time and my husbands family never did.",t3_ib7cew
1242,Miscarriage,"I'm just devasted and I feel so hopeless. This is my third time getting pregnant and my third miscarriage. I really thought this was the one. I got a hysteroscopy in June to remove polyps, which we thought was the cause of the other two MCs. I just was so in love with my baby already, who would have been born in April. A Taurus, like my husband and my dad. Just found out I was pregnant on Friday, and started bleeding today. I feel numb. And I feel bad for my husband, because he got stuck with a wife that can't do this. I never want to go through this again. I am completely done with the whole thing. I'm never going to be a mommy. It's so unfair.",t3_ib7em0
1243,Miscarriage,Hey everyone I just had my first miscarriage the past couple days. I've been passing tissue and clots for about 4 days now. My miscarriage was a blighted ovum that never developed an embryo and the sac stopped growing at 5w 6d. When I miscarried I actually passed the sac whole (you usually do early on) and I was able to clean it and see that it was a little bubble of fluid you could see through if anyone Is wondering what to expect to see with a blighted ovum. Then i passed 1 tennis ball sized clot and the others where ranged from a little smaller than that to around the size of a quarter. It felt like extreme labor pains that had me breathless. Luckily I had my husband with me. The past few days I've basically been on bedrest with how bad my body hurts and how bad my cramps are still. I was supposed to see my OB tomorrow to discuss if i would miscarry or not and I called them at the beginning but they told me they still didnt want to see me until the 17th so I waited and it took me by surprise. I only took tylenol 1 time the whole time. I would have taken more but it just didn't help me. Now I feel like I'm going through PPD and I'm gonna discuss with my OB some options for that. And the fact I'm still cramping and bleeding heavy. Tomorrow I have a transvaginal ultrasound and I'm terrified because I'm in so much pain already and have so much pressure on myself already that I know the ultrasound is gonna hurt. (The lady who did it the 2nd time around having one wasnt very gentle.) I just feel so broken down and sad...I dont feel like myself and I just dont know how to cope fully. I feel so helpless and needy to my family and I know they love me and are here for me and want to help but I cant help but feel so worthless... I'm sorry for the rant/ pity party  I just dont feel like myself. Thank you for reading.,t3_ib6vzb
1244,Miscarriage,"Hi all, will keep this short. Had MMC and a d&amp;c, body wasn’t naturally miscarrying. Have felt ill (chills, 99.5) so went to gyno earlier than follow up. He gave me Misoprostol, because he said my uterine lining was thick, and possible tissue retained. I have zero pelvic pain, no discharge. Some bleeding to be expected. I advocated for myself, I did not want to take the pills. I had a horrible experience with them once and will NEVER take them again. Asked for other options because I know there are. He said no. Treated me as if I was in an assembly line of women who miscarry. And didn’t care what I had to say. For reference in the Operating room he did not say hi or wish me well, he was texting. I went to Er after the appointment, they told me just thick uterine lining and some trauma from surgery (blood). No product. Gave me a number to a different OB. I have really bad health anxiety, and so I need to get into this new OB tomorrow am because I do not want or need an infection but I also will not take miso. Has anyone changed Obs during such a time? Can I even do it? Will they accept me? I absolutely refuse to go back to my old practice.",t3_iayb4n
1245,Miscarriage,"I had a D&amp;C on Thursday. I was 9 weeks 4 days but baby didn’t grow past 6 weeks, only the sac continued to grow.
I left the hospital feeling okay and with minimal bleeding. I thought that was normal because I had one D&amp;C before (for retained placenta after a 16 week loss) and I actually only bled for 3 days after and never really felt much pain.
This one though, this one has been hell. My pain is terrible and their version of pain management was to rotate Tylenol and Motrin. I called Friday evening at 3:30 PM to tell them that wasn’t cutting it and of course they never called me back, it being late on Friday I’m assuming. I’ve made it through the weekend with copious amounts of OTC meds, a nonstop heating pad and not moving. If I do get up and move around I can feel clots moving down ward and I’ll have to go to the bathroom to pass them. I barely bled with my first D&amp;C!
I just don’t know what is normal and I’m trying not to freak myself out. Looking for other D&amp;C experiences. Thank you in advance!",t3_ib4fzp
1246,Miscarriage,"Hello everyone, i have been a lurker of this page for a couple of months now. Since miscarrying i have needed a source of support and reading all of your stories, advice and kind words has really helped me alot. I just wanna say i am sorry to everyone on this feed, it is a truly saddening and horrible thing to go through. I am here 100% to support and listen to all of you if ever needed. I am a message away. 

Just some backstory, last october i found out i was pregnant, i was already a few weeks along and was super excited, me and my partner had been trying for some time. This was my first pregnancy.
A few weeks into december i had a miscarriage, i was 13 weeks along. I had my miscarriage the day before i was due a scan. It was a horrifying experience. I remember going for my scan the next day and sitting in a room full of happy, healthy pregnant women. They all looked so excited with their hands on their big bumps.
My eyes started to water, i wanted to cry so badly looking at all these women. I felt so jealous and angry. 

A few weeks after my scan and i was still in extreme pain and was constantly vomiting. I had to have a D&amp;E to remove everything. It was again horrifying. 
After that the physical pain stopped but the emotional pain continued. I blamed myself and i don't know why. I thought it was all my fault. 

Now, months later and i am still so upset by it. I just have this huge desire to become pregnant again. I can't help it but its like a huge obsession. Has anyone else experienced this and if so how did you cope?",t3_iaqxc2
1247,Miscarriage,"I had an 8 week ultrasound scheduled for tomorrow, but I woke up last Tuesday and all my pregnancy symptoms were gone. I went in for an ultrasound that was supposed to ease my mind, but they found that the baby was only 5 weeks where I should’ve been measuring 7. Did some bloodwork, and got a call the next morning letting me know that the pregnancy was no longer viable. 

I’ve been drinking every night since to battle the depression that’s been coming up. I’m fine during the day while I’m distracted with work, but at night I get hopeless. My husband and I started trying in April of 2019 and found out in December that I had PCOS plus a completely septate uterus - I had surgery to correct both in February. Prior to the surgery, my period hadn’t come for 10 months but after, it was like clockwork and came every 28 days. I thought this pregnancy was it for me, only to find out that I lost it. Trying not to blame myself but I feel like this entire TTC process has just been one setback after another. I’m also trying to stay positive and hope that theres a healthy pregnancy and baby in my future, but my great-grandmother and grandmother both suffered from multiple miscarriages so I’m not sure what to do at this point. 

I have a follow-up scheduled for this Tuesday to discuss my options if nothing happens naturally, but yesterday I started spotting dark brown. Today, I passed a clot (as small as my pinky fingernail) still spotting brown/red but not sure the point I’m at in miscarrying. I’m having cramps and lower back pain, I’d say the cramps are a 3 on a pain scale of 10 whereas my normal period cramps are at a 1-2. With my period, I have light cramping and normal bleeding so I have no idea what to expect from this. Can anyone share their experience/pain level/etc. of miscarrying between 5-6 weeks? As of right now, I get a strong(ish) cramp every 30 minutes or so, so I’m hoping that means it’ll happen soon. I just want this to be over with so that I can start trying to heal.",t3_ib198j

I had no idea how heavy the fear and anxiety of miscarrying again was. That is, until I miscarried for the second time, in four months. 

Once my fear became my reality, that anxiety was gone. 

Through the following moments of slow surreal understanding and deep sadness, there is levity. Levity I’m so grateful for. 

I need some time before we try again. Time to find tools for managing anxiety. And time to find moments of joy again.",t3_iax5y1
1250,Miscarriage,"I was just wondering if anyone has ovulated while still bleeding or spotting from the miscarriage?

1252,Miscarriage,"I had a miscarriage at six weeks and six days on Thursday. I had a scan the next day on Friday and they didn't see anything except a thickened lining. The doctor said I might have already passed something, and I had. I didn't realize it at the time but on Thursday evening when I wiped there was a little (half of my pinky nail) round, rubbery thing. Would that have been the gestational sac?

I am now wondering what happened... Was this a blighted ovum / anembryonic pregnancy?

My last menstrual period was June 27. On July 31 my HCG was only at 113. I don't know how high it got in between but I don't imagine very much because it was always on the very, very low end but on August 13, my HCG was at 96 which confirmed I was miscarrying.

I want to know what went wrong so that I know what to address in the future. Was my lining too thin? It was 8 mm on a scan on July 27. Is that why the gestational sac came off? Because it couldn't attach itself successfully?

I'm just confused... Why did I pass it? Is that normal? Is it indicative of any issue? And because I passed it, does that mean it was NOT a missed miscarriage?

What kind of testing should me and my partner get done either A) for reassurance that everything is okay chromosomally too, and B) so we can begin to address any issues.

Thank you. My heart goes out to anyone who has experienced loss.",t3_iav4kn

Quick warning, this is going to be a bit descriptive!

On Wednesday I took 4x200mg Miso. I would have been 10 weeks but baby stopped growing around 6.

Cramping started within the hour and I was bleeding by two hours in. I started passing clots and tissue about 4 hours in and passed what I assume was the sac (about the size of a lemon).
After that the bleeding and cramps died down and wasn’t too bad, until yesterday.

The bleeding and cramps came back with a vengeance yesterday but today is worse. I’m bleeding super heavy, I literally feel it pouring out of me and can’t get off the toilet, the cramps are just as bad as the worst of it on the day I took the tablets if not slightly more painful.

The early pregnancy unit told me to call them if I had any concerns, however they are shut today. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or is it normal for the pain and bleeding to come back a few days on? I really don’t want to go to A&amp;E unless absolutely needed

1255,Miscarriage,"We've been trying to conceive now for about a year. Around this time last year, I went to Doctor because things just didn't feel right. She found cervical polyps inside and out, and we did a D&amp;C to remove polyps and clean it out in there (fibroid/ tissue). 

In March, we got pregnant. Something about it just seemed ""off"" to me. My first pregnancy for my son (5 yrs old now), had not experienced the cramping or spotting. At about 7 weeks, we miscarried naturally. I hadn't been to doctor's office due to Covid and they didn't want me going to the ER due to Covid. They sent me for ultrasound the following Monday to confirm it was not ectopic, and ultrasound confirmed there was nothing left of my pregnancy.

Now, at almost 6 weeks, I am miscarrying again. Started with spotting this past Tuesday. Rushed back home (we were 4 hours away at a cottage) and an ultrasound confirmed there was a gestational sac, but no heartbeat. Doctor advised it might be too early for heartbeat, but wanted to take serial HCG to check hormones doubling. They are not. They remained the same. Spotting is progressively getting worse, and i am cramping. 

In addition to being heartbroken, i feel overwhelmed with the options the Doctor is putting forth. Doctor advised we could do a D&amp;C, medication to expedite the process or natural. My last was natural, I had no choice in the matter due to Covid. I guess I'm just looking for women's experiences of why they chose (or were forced due to medical complications) one way or another. If a D&amp;C will help my pregnancies survive, I am open to that, but I had one last August/September, and am afraid that additional surgeries will further complicate things? Should I get a second opinion from a fertility expert?

TL/DR: 2nd miscarriage, have already had a D&amp;C a year ago, having a hard time deciding upon another D&amp;C, medication or natural miscarriage. Should I see a fertility doctor, beyond my obgyn?",t3_iau8wr
1256,Miscarriage,"Trigger warning: suicidal thoughts/ideations, graphic descriptions

Long story but would really appreciate any thoughts/words of encouragement 

Hi all, 
So I had a MMC on June 29. I was 8 weeks along, baby was only 5.5 weeks, I took miso to pass it. It was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. I found what was supposed to be my baby in my underwear. I’ve cried for what feels like every single day since then. I miss my baby so unbearably much, miss the thought of holding my sweet angel, feeding her from my breast as I tell her all the dreams I have for her. I would talk to my sweet little baby in my tummy and beg her to grow nice and strong. But she was already gone at that point. 
I also have bipolar disorder and severe anxiety/depression. My bipolar disorder has been stable since I was 17 (I’m 28 now), after having a suicide attempt at 16 and needing a psychiatric stay. I got on the right combination of mood stabilizer and anti depressant, so I didn’t really experience the bipolar mood swings much, at least never to the point that I thought about taking my life again. I never let my bipolar disorder or anxiety stop me from working or living a normal life. But then I miscarried and I was in this horrible funk where I cried every single day. I felt like I was in a hole I couldn’t climb out of. But that’s how grief always feels. 
But things were looking up finally. 5 weeks to the day after my miscarriage I was supposed to start my new career. I finally got the job I’ve been working for, an elementary school teacher. When I showed up for the training I found out I’ll actually be a secondary teacher (not the job that I agreed to OR was in my contract), and the charter school it was couldn’t decide if we’d have online, hybrid, or face to face learning bc of COVID. They finally settled on complete face to face teaching, despite the fact that our local school district is starting the year hybrid. 
My training was supposed to be two weeks. It went well the first two days, but then it all turned to shit. I knew teachers work hard, and I have absolutely no problem with that. I’ve always been a hard worker and I usually take pride and pleasure in working hard. And I’ve been busting my ass getting certified to be a teacher, subbing for classroom experience, etc. It finally paid off and I landed what I thought was the perfect job at the perfect school. I never thought teaching would be easy, always knew how hard teachers work, and always thought I’d enjoy it. But the training was absolute hell. I could not handle the stress, which Ive always been able to get through before. I was having several panic attacks each day, and crying to several other teachers and the principal and vice principal. I felt like someone was sitting on my chest and I  couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t even keep any makeup on my face because I was crying so so much. I felt like I was in a huge crater I wouldn’t never be able to get out from. I kept trying to muddle through, just crying every day from the time I woke up to the time I went to sleep, several panic attacks each day. I didn’t want to quit, I’ve never been a quitter and didn’t wanna start now. I was excited for the insurance and benefits, summers off, retirement, etc., and I knew I couldn’t give that up. I kept pushing through. Everyone told me it would get better after the first couple weeks. But then I started thinking about taking all my pills at once. Started thinking about crashing my car into a cement wall. I started wishing I would go to sleep and never wake up. I wanted so badly to go back to my comfortable job where I wasn’t under so much stress and I knew what I was doing, but at the same time I didn’t want to give up. I confided in my loved ones about my suicidal thoughts and ended up going to the crisis center. I got a referral to go to another doctor to have a med adjustment and I’m starting counseling on Monday. I decided to put my teaching career on hold, which unfortunately meant bailing on my amazing job right before school started. I felt and feel horrible but my principal was very kind and understanding. But I feel like a huge fucking loser. A huge waste. A huge disappointment. I feel like everyone is judging me. Then I started to feel like my best friend since grade school is trying to sabotage me (paranoid thoughts for the win). I decided to stay at my current job, which Is still a great job and allows me to be able to pay my bills. But I gave up my dream. 
At the beginning of June, I thought I’d be a great teacher this year, and a great mom in February. But now I’ve given up teaching (for now, perhaps. I’m not sure) and there’s no baby coming anytime soon. 
I’m sorry, I know this is long. I guess what I’m looking for is some support or similar stories. Thank you for reading.",t3_iapbxw
1257,Miscarriage,"They found my missed miscarriage at a 10 week scan last week. This was my second pregnancy and I had been blithely confident about it. I actually had never heard of a MMC before, I thought if I were to miscarry I would have seen some blood one day, so I was floored when the nurse said the fetus was only 8 weeks in size with no heartbeat. 

So I had the D&amp;C, which went as well as could be expected. The first couple of days afterwards were fine, just some mild cramping and light bleeding. They had told me to get some pads and some painkillers in, and if I needed stronger painkillers to get them from my GP. I stupidly only got paracetamol, so three days later when my contractions started in the middle of the night I didn’t have anything else. I would definitely recommend arming yourself with the strongest painkillers you can get. These cramps / contractions felt worse to me than labour had been. Is that even possible? Am I just misremembering labour? This lasted about 8 hours and I couldn’t sleep at all during that time, I was often doubled over, or on all fours, trying to manage the pain. Needless to say the paracetamol did nothing! As soon as the chemist opened my partner went and got me Nurofen Plus (ibuprofen with codeine) and that helped, but I think things had also calmed down at that point anyway. 

It doesn’t make sense to me that this was worse than labour. It was only an 8 week fetus and the D&amp;C surely had taken everything out anyway. I called the hospital in the middle of the night and a kind nurse spoke to me and assured me it was normal. I had no fever and I wasn’t soaking my pads, so nothing to do but wait it out. My town has no 24 hour chemist. 

Anyway. It seems to be better now, just back to mild cramping again. Good luck to you all, I’m sorry that you’re all experiencing loss.",t3_iao9wx

1263,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone. As someone who has gone through infertility for the last 5.5 years, I’ve become quite interested in different numbers. During my 10w pregnancy I was very curious about how fast/slow my numbers might be dropping but no one ordered labs and there’s not much info out there on google when you try to search. Obviously this is a very individual thing that depends on a number of factors, but I thought I would share my own numbers for my 6w miscarriage for anyone else that may search for this. 

7/6: 13,825 - at this point I was still pregnant and this number had risen appropriately from the previous number

7/11: this is when the bleeding and miscarriage started

7/17: 917

7/27: 123

Went off BC and had pretty rare periods, found out I ovulate irregularly/rarely and was diagnosed with PCOS. I became pregnant on my first dose of letrozole but then miscarried.",t3_iaecdf
1265,Miscarriage,"TLDR; what are your experiences and recommendations for testing after [two] miscarriages?

Well, it happened again. I had a MMC in April (6-7 weeks growth which I miscarried between 14-15 weeks). And two days ago I went in for a 12 week scan to find that my baby stopped growing at 10+3. I wasn’t surprised as I had been spotting for two days. I ended up completing the miscarriage the same day. 

The good news is that my partner and I seem to be able to get pregnant. Of the 3 cycles we have TTC, we’ve conceived in 2 of them. The trouble, it seems to me, is chromosomal, hormonal, or placental.

Our initial thought is to do a tiered approach to testing and trying again in a few months. 

1.a) Genetic screening for me and my partner.  
1.b) Next I’d like to get a full thyroid panel, and hormonal panel (thinking most of my progesterone levels).  

Possibly trying again after those results, and support options the results yield.
If we miscarry again we will likely proceed with the following: 

2.a) evaluation of my uterus and my partner’s sperm. Possibly an evaluation of my ovaries and ovum as well.
2.b) testing of the fetal and placental tissue to try determine a cause of miscarriage. This is something we thought about having done this time. However, the timeframe was too narrow, coming into the weekend with my insurance approval needed prior. 

For those who are still reading, and have experience with getting to the bottom of fertility issues, what are some recommendations y’all have for us? Testing options I haven’t mentioned? A different order of testing? We’re flexible and eager to have more information about our situation.

I decided on taking the pill in hopes to move thing along and get everything out without d&amp;c. I'm still waiting on the pharmacy to fill the script and now I'm getting nervous to take them. The Dr said bleeding would start within 6-12 hours. Has anyone taken the pill? How did it go was it painful, or just like a period but more bleeding? Just don't know what to expect",t3_ia7u9e

My niece was born on my ...fetus's due date and now every time I look at her I feel pain, sadness, and loss because that would have been how old my baby would have been. I don't want to feel like that when I see my beautiful niece, how do I get over this?",t3_i9zex3
1268,Miscarriage,"I had a missed miscarriage, at 7 weeks. Tuesday I went in for my d&amp;c as my body was not miscarrying naturally. I was an anxious mess for weeks. Long story short- left the d&amp;c feeling as one would usually feel. Groggy, little cramping, light spotting. Wed I woke up feeling as if I had come down with a sinus infection. My whole head was congested, and I had chills and a low grade fever (never above 100), Thursday I felt the same, however no bleeding whatsoever and no cramping. I made an appointment to go into my OB office because I felt something was off. Saw her today and she did an ultrasound. Explained to me that my uterine lining appeared thick, and that she could see either tissue left behind, or blood clots. She also informed me that she got the results back from a lab and that the fetus and sac was successfully removed. (Thought that was the point). Anyway, while this is happening she also says she is waiting on chromosome tests from my fetus to come back, and that I could have a molar pregnancy. The conversation brought me to tears because I truly felt like I was talking to someone who should really know what they’re talking about, meanwhile everything is so up in the air. After giving me NO options, and telling her how I’ve felt the last couple of days, she sent me home with miso pills and an antibiotic. I am absolutely TERRIFIED to take miso. I have heard such horrible stories about it, and I feel like I’ve already been through so much. It feels unfair. I also feel, quite literally, SICK. As if I have come down with sinus, or some other infection. I don’t have any pelvic pains, or bleeding. But I do have a yellow watery discharge that she told me was normal. I am honestly at the point where I am going to go to an ER and spend hours upon hours just to get everything checked and figured out. I have lost all faith in my doctor at this point. 
Could what I’m feeling be from an infection from leftover tissue? Could I actually be sick with something else while at the same time going through this. Would you take the miso even while feeling like absolute sh*t? ER?
I am lost.

1269,Miscarriage,"This has been over the span of the last 5 days. I was late for my period last Saturday. I took a test on Monday, positive. Took 2 tests on Tuesday, positive. I woke up with a headache Wednesday and started getting cramping mid morning, followed by bright red blood. 

I went to the hospital as directed by telehealth. The doctor did a urine test, negative. Sent me for ultrasounds, nothing. I took another 2 tests at home, positive. The doctor sent me to check my blood HCG Thursday and it was slightly risen. He sent me again today, and it came back the exact same (?). The cramping stopped last night, and bleeding has been fairly light (lighter than a normal period) 

I’m just really not sure what is going on with my body. I have never heard of HCG levels staying the same, only rising or falling. The doctor is continuing to send me for HCG until it reaches 0, but he seems very concerned that it could be an ectopic pregnancy. Has anyone else experienced something similar?",t3_i9yrdu

1271,Miscarriage,"Hello everybody.


It's the first time that I post here so I'm sorry if I don't format well or if this doesn't belong here. And I apologize for any grammar mistake, English isn't my first langage.


I just had a message from my sister. She had her first echo today. She is (was) 8 weeks pregnant. They couldn't find the embryo, and concluded that there was none and she is probably going to miscarriage very soon. 


She is devastated. Her mother tried to have children for 12 years and had miscarriage after miscarriage. Then, she died 1 year after the birth of my sister. So my sister is extremely scared that history will repeat itself, that she will also have trouble having children. 


I am so sad for her. I don't know what to say, or if anything that I could say, will make her feel better. I need advice:what can I do, what can I say? Is there anything that I can do to help her get through those difficult times? 


(I call her my sister but we are not related. We just knew each other since we were 4, so we took the habit of referring to each other as sisters - but her mother isnt my mother)",t3_i9pwd0
1272,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone. I got pregnant with my first child in february. I was due Nov. 1st. I miscarried at 9 weeks and had a D&amp;C at the hospital. with my due date still not having passed, I feel like it’s looming over me like a dark cloud. i’ve been in therapy for 2 years, so i’ve had help working through my feelings, but living in a covid bubble type world, I have been stuck inside social distancing since march when covid hit where I live. it’s made it really hard to move on when I feel stuck at home. 

Anyways, today I got a call from a doula that we were looking to set up a birth plan with. I contacted them pretty soon into my pregnancy because I have ptsd and didn’t want to feel disoriented in any way during birth and I wanted to make sure it was a calm, safe, comfortable environment for me so I could really enjoy it. Obviously in my pain i forgot to contact them, along with the cord blood registry, etc and tell them I miscarried. It just really threw me for a loop and messed up my day today. 

does anyone feel like they need to have their due date come and go before they feel fully healed? I feel like that day passing and there is no baby, it’ll really really truly hit me that it’s over. 

I feel so dumb that i’m so effected by this, and I just wish every single day my baby was here with me. 

thank you all for listening.",t3_i9vnts
1273,Miscarriage,"An ultrasound this morning confirmed that there’s no heartbeat (the last one had a faint heartbeat but no growth, so I knew it was coming.) I’m 9 weeks pregnant but the embryo stopped growing measuring  6W1D.

I have the choice between misoprostol or surgery - I would prefer the surgery, but the nurse said that they are scheduling farther out than usual but didn’t know the exact availability. A scheduler is supposed to call either this afternoon or Monday; no call yet.

If I call back in the next couple of hours, I could get the medication for this weekend. I am really torn between wanting to get it over with (it’s been a month of pregnancy limbo already), and not wanting to experience the medicated process. If I knew I could have surgery next week, I’d definitely choose that; but possibly waiting until Monday and then finding out it’s another 10 days’ wait for surgery would be wretched. Does anyone have experience/advice?",t3_i9qb67
1274,Miscarriage,"Warning: This post will contain some graphic descriptions of my miscarriage.

Hello, I really just want to vent or get feedback from someone because I feel ignored by my doctor's office, and I feel like they made a traumatic experience even more traumatic by their lack of care/incompetence.

First of all this, this was my first pregnancy, so I never really had an idea of what to expect to begin with. Everything was a new experience for me. I was about 6 weeks along when all of this started. Anyway, last Thursday, I started experience a very light pink spotting. I called the office, just to let them know what was happening (I hadn't even had my first appointment with them yet; it was supposed to be next Tuesday), and the nurse I spoke too wasn't rude necessarily, but she was still kind of cold. She just kept telling me that it was normal and they get this call multiple times a day. I was able to breath a sigh of relief at that point, and go about my day.

However, over the weekend my bleeding became heavier and was now a bright red, so I called them Monday morning, and they said I should come in and see the NP. At this point, I was really happy that they were working me in so quickly. I explained to them that my bleeding had turned bright red, I was passing blood clots all weekend, but that morning I had passed a large clot. In addition, I had some pinching pain on the left side. She told me that 6 weeks was too soon for an ultrasound, and the only thing they could do was blood work to make sure my hCG levels were doubling. My husband was there with me, and she told us we would have the results back on Thursday. He asked if there were any signs that we should look for that indicated that we need to go to the ER, and she said if I start bleeding through a pad an hour, other than that, I was fine. She also said that if I miscarry, there is nothing they can do to stop it, and I understand that.

On Wednesday morning, I went in for my second round of blood work, but I started feeling really sick that night and the bleeding got heavier until I finally passed a small bit of fleshy tissue. I saved it because I didn't know if it was something they should see or not. I was supposed to get a call back on Thursday with my results, and I was waiting for them to call, so I could tell them what happened. I also knew that my numbers were more than likely not good at this point, but I still wanted to hear it from them. Toward the end of the day, I decide to call them myself to let them know what was going on and to see if I could get my results (they had not uploaded them to my portal either). The lady I spoke to was rude and told me that they were closing in 15 minutes and someone would call me tomorrow. I told her I was supposed to get the results back today, and she said, ""Well no one has reviewed them."" So this morning, I called first thing in the morning, and left a message on the nurses' voicemail explaining what had happened to me, and that I still have pinching on my left side, headaches, and dizziness. I wanted to know if they could confirm that I did in fact miscarry or if I need a D&amp;C, and I'm still curious about my lab results.  An hour and half went by, and no one called me back, so I called and left a second message, but I had bit more urgency in my tone on that message.

 Finally, at noon, 4 hours after my initial message, a woman called to tell me that they got my message, and they will call back when someone reads my results. I was so furious that it took her 4 hours to call and tell me nothing. So I asked her, ""What about my other symptoms, I feel like you guys are ignoring my other health concerns and are not answering any of my questions."" She got a really rude tone with me and told me to go to the ER if I was so concerned. I had her on speaker, and my husband spoke up that that point, and she started to change her tone. They argued back and forth for a while, and finally hung up. Ten minutes later, I get another call back from a different nurse who told me that my numbers only raised slightly, and I was probably going to miscarry. I reminded her that I left multiple messages explaining that I already thought I did, and I wanted to know if I need a scan or should be concerned about a D&amp;C. She told me that they can't do a scan at 6 weeks because they wouldn't be able to see anything and D&amp;C wouldn't be necessary because I wasn't far enough along for that. Then she added, ""As a matter of fact your levels were only 80, and that is very low. It was never a healthy pregnancy to begin with, but you can come back on Monday to do more blood work, and we need to set up a follow up exam."" I asked why that was necessary if she already knew that they can't do a scan and I don't need a D&amp;C? She said they still need to follow the blood work. 

Anyway, I was so frustrated with their slow responses and lack of empathy that I ended up calling back and canceling that appointment. I feel like I have been jerked around and it just seemed like a bullshit response. I also never want to go back to that office again. I thought maybe I could do more research and call another office explain that I had a miscarriage, and I would like to get in for blood work with them. At least that way, I will be established with someone else for when we do decide to try again.

Am I being overly emotional about this? Do I need to be concerned about any of my symptoms? I don't really feel like I trust them. Another thing that I don't like about this office is that you only get to see a NP until your second trimester. They won't do a heartbeat scan or ultrasound until you are 12 weeks. My sister lives in another city, but she told me that she got to listen to a heartbeat at 7 weeks.

TL;DR

I've been experiencing the symptoms of a miscarriage all week, and I'm pretty sure I already did miscarry. My doctor's office is slow to respond and are rude on the phone. I'm worried about my symptoms of headache and dizziness, as well as confirming that I actually did miscarry (they won't do a scan at 6 weeks to confirm).",t3_i9r62g

1276,Miscarriage,"First of all I’d like to send out my deepest condolences to those of you in this thread 🙏🏻 i am reaching out because my sister was T boned on her side this past weekend. It resulted in not only the loss of 7 month old baby, but also her uterus leaving her infertile. She just woke up out of an induced coma after beating a severe battle with internally bleeding where she practically flatlined for a good while. She was already struggling with depression and this pregnancy took all that away. She is now awake and going through multiple surgery’s for broken bones &amp; she’s just been notified they asked her if she wanted to hold &amp; keep the baby while she was completely out of it (she doesn’t recall) so along with all other trauma she is now feeling the guilt of not comforting her baby before parting ways. She is in desperate need of encouragement, support, and amazingly strong / resilient individuals who can relate to her pain. God bless you all, I admire your courage and resilience  🙏🏻❤️",t3_i9d17d

Hello all.
I am posting in hopes that this will be cathartic for me and/or others who have experienced a “natural” miscarriage can offer some advice. I am using a throwaway acct.

Last week I woke up with some dark brown blood in my underwear. Not enough to use a pad and really only noticeable after wiping post urination. I called my OB and spoke to a nurse. She assured me that everything was probably fine (bleeding happens) and said that just to reassure me, I could come in that day for U/S.

I went in and had ultrasound. Baby looked great. Heartbeat was 162 and dancing around. As it turns out there was no sign of a hemorrhage or placenta problems.

My OB decided to do a pelvic exam and check everything out. She confirmed there was a good amount of “older brown blood” pooled in my vaginal cavity. My cervix was long and completely closed. She determined the bleeding was normal breakthrough bleeding from the increase of hormones. I was sent home with the assurance that things would be fine and I should call if the bleeding turned bright red and increased. 

The next morning I woke up around 5am with slightly uncomfortable cramps. I could feel them on and off between my lower back and lower abdominal area. I was trying to stay calm. I went to use the restroom and that’s when I saw the first “bright red blood”. 

What happened from there has just been a nightmare. Maybe 20 minutes after that I went back to the restroom and sat on the toilet. I felt a kinda twinge (don’t want to call it a pop but maybe??) and then felt fluid and blood come out. I honestly talked myself into believing I probably pee’d myself and some blood came out with it.

Cramps were still happening and I went to sit on the toilet again about 20 minutes later. When I did I quickly felt a gush of blood and very distinctly a number of clots came out. In that moment I was so shocked all I can remember is praying to God begging that really didn’t just happen. And maybe it wasn’t that bad.

It all just happened so fast. Like from the waking up at 5am to present was probably an hour?? My OB doesn’t open until 7:30am.

*Worst part so please don’t read if you will be triggered*
So the day before when I had the brown blood I took a picture to show the nurse/doctor. The nurse thanked me and told me it was easier to see what I was talking about. 
So in my mind I thought I should try to retrieve a clot from the toilet to take a picture of. So the doctor could visualize the size of it and hopefully use it to diagnose what was going on. The toilet was filled with blood and I couldn’t see anything distinctly. I got a kitchen tool to try and pull one out and saw the baby. Looked like a perfect tiny baby doll. My husband was already on his way home from work (I called him after I felt the clots come out) and I basically lost my shit. I truly had no idea that something so horrible could happen and I don’t know if I will ever get over what happened.

Long story short....called OB when they opened and they had me come in immediately after they opened. Had ultrasound and it confirmed that everything was just GONE. Like gone. Almost 12 weeks pregnant and went from a “healthy” fetus the day before to a completely empty uterus!????? 

I am a week out now and finally beginning to come to terms with this. I have been heavy bleeding/clotting every day since then but seems to be lightening up today. I did not have to have a D&amp;C (which I’m grateful for) but this is like another different type of hell.

I made a throwaway for this (I basically never post or comment on my main account anyway) but I truly apologize if I fucked up the formatting or this is inappropriate here. I just hurt so badly and I never realized something so traumatic could happen. 
Thank you for reading and I hope everyone stays well.",t3_i95357
1278,Miscarriage,"TW: CP

I’m on my second chemical pregnancy in a row. I have no idea why but these are so friggen painful. I have long cycles so each of these have been during a 80+ day cycle, so maybe that’s why, but I have been in so much pain today I feel pathetic. I was pregnant for like 4 days and I’m popping Advil and moaning in pain. I know it should be over soon so I’m just trying to think of the light at the end of the tunnel but I’m telling you I have so much respect and awe for women that are going through this later in pregnancy at home. My god. You are so strong and boy do I wish none of us have to go through this again.",t3_i9asv5
1279,Miscarriage,"In the past 4 days I’ve had a 4 different friends announce their pregnancy.  The last one got pregnant the same time I did.  I miscarries, she didn’t.  It was her full belly picture to announce their arrival.

She suffered a loss as well, it when during the same time as my second miscarriage.  

I’m happy for her, but I feel so hollow.

After 3 miscarriages, my husband wants to give up.  He says our relationship is not unstable.  I believe it’s unstable because of our 3 miscarriages and the emotional rollercoaster in such a small time.

We’re in couples counseling, I’m in a support group.",t3_i8xc5r

1281,Miscarriage,"I would be 5 weeks 3 days today. I've known intuitively for the last week that something was wrong. I called the doctor and explained that something was wrong, so she ordered a beta test. Coincidentally, the drop in HCG was confirmed today, which is also when the bleeding started. I can't talk about it without breaking down. My husband is being completely emotionally unavailable and I don't have anyone to talk to.",t3_i9fbnl
1282,Miscarriage,I got this done from the rec of my holistic doctor and turned out I had the genetic mutation so my body doesn't break down folic acid properly. He put me on a different supplemental regime to replace my prenatal. Was just wondering if anyone else did it. I will keep you all posted though on it's effectiveness!,t3_i9dmbq
1283,Miscarriage,"So my last period was may 19 and I missed two periods before I found out I was pregnant, so my obgyn office had a difficult time telling how far along I was, they had me come in a week later for an ultrasound.
They couldn’t see anything through the vaginal ultrasound so they did another Pregnancy Test, it came back positive and they said it was likely it was just too early to see anything through an ultrasound. They had me go get bloodwork done to see my HCG levels and to rule out ectopic. They made me get the blood work one day then again two days later. When they called me with the results they said I was definitely pregnant. But didn’t tell me if it was ectopic. 

Skip in about a week I start getting some brown dried looking blood when I wipe and I call my obgyn on call (because their office is closed on weekends and it was a Sunday) the on call midwife said I was fine and I didn’t have to go to the er until I’m as filling a whole pad every hour. After an hour we decided to go to the ER just to be sure. I’ve never been pregnant and my partner has never been with anyone who was pregnant so we were scared and worried.

I waited in the waiting room for 7 hours, only once getting called in to get a vaginal ultrasound again and to get bloodwork, when I was giving them a urine sample I noticed I started bleeding a lot and there were small blood clots. I let the nurses know and they just asked if I wanted a pad and then wanted to carry on with the blood work and ultrasound. They told me to wait in the waiting room that it would be 1 hour until they had the results and they’d call me back in. I waited 4 hours and kept checking in, as time passed I was passing bigger clots and the bleeding was getting heavier. Finally I was called in and they did blood again and left me waiting another hour in the private room. Someone else came in and said “you’re about 5 weeks pregnant it’s hard to tell but there was a sac in the ultrasound this time and your hcg levels are rising just not exactly how we want them to” then they discharged me not prescribing me anything or saying anything about if I was miscarrying, what I should do, etc.
At this point it was almost midnight we drove home and shortly into the drive home I started having contraction like cramps. I got into bed as soon as I got home and that’s when the cramps started getting unbearable. I was crying and yelling in pain for hours, the cramps would go for a minute or two then come back. I was so exhausted I didn’t think I could take anymore and then finally I think the exhaustion hit me and when the cramps went away for a minute or two I passed out before they came back.

A part of me was in denial thinking maybe the baby was fine, because no nurse seemed concerned or sympathetic and none of them said I was miscarrying or could be. 

The next day a midwife at my obgyn office called and told me I suffered a miscarriage. She told me that my hcg levels weren’t rising properly and it wasn’t a stable pregnancy. 

I’m trying not to put the blame on anyone else but I wish someone would’ve told me, I wish I had a better obgyn in the beginning so they could’ve told me what to do if this had happened, inform me about certain things, guide me.
My obgyn barely spoke English and spoke one sentence to me that I could barely understand then left. And the nurses were terrible to patients including me and weren’t telling me a thing and discharged me with no help or information on if I was miscarrying and what I should do, 
I might sound blameful but I just feel that if I was better informed and the nurses and obgyn cared a little more or were sympathetic I would have sealed with things a lot easier.
I’m still coping with everything and it was all really traumatizing as silly as it sounds, knowing I was losing my baby and no one gave a damn, I was left to sit for 7 hours passing clot after clot just to be told nothing and sent home to pass everything naturally, I literally had to look everything up on the Internet.
I’m grateful I wasn’t farther along, but it still hurts and I’m still grieving. We were so excited and happy and I never thought something like this could be happening to me.",t3_i9b0bb
1284,Miscarriage,I found out Monday we are no longer pregnant well currently I’m waiting till Tuesday to have a d&amp;c.  Today was my first day back to work since I don’t really have sick time left. It was ok for a few hours then I just wanted to cry and crawl into my bed. I had a successful ultrasound at 6w5d with heartbeat and was beyond excited for this. I don’t know how to not be crushed and emotional. My doctors think I should take more time off but I’m not sure what my options are my company did give me two extra sick days because of my miscarriage but how is that enough? Specially when I’m forced to walk around knowing the baby is still inside me for the next 5 days. I literally can’t stop thinking about it.,t3_i9anps
1285,Miscarriage,"My miscarriage started on Sunday, and I passed my little peppercorn on Monday. The worst of the bleeding was over by Monday night.

I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow, but symptoms I'm having are scaring me (these only started the morning of the day I started to miscarry). I have a severe constant headache that won't go away with painkillers, really bad dizziness, fainting and severe nausea. I've tried anti-nausea pills that I was prescribed for something unrelated a while ago, and I've also been taking painkillers for my head. Nothing is helping. Even lying down, I still feel like I'm going to faint. The staff at the early pregnancy unit didn't take me seriously at all, and I've been being passed from pillar to post between them and my GP to try and get some answers. I cannot continue with daily life whilst feeling like this, I feel absolutely debilitated.

Surely this cannot be normal? I need to hear that this will go away😭",t3_i9adug
1286,Miscarriage,"I was a few days late for my period. I started feeling sick and couldnt eat anything. That night i was woken up by extreme pain and was very sick feeling. When i went to the restroom the next morning there was a lot of light and very dark blood. But also a shredded chunk of..skin?? It was pale and very odd. About the size of a postit note? Very thick and clumpy. 
Ive always had chunks harsh periods but this was really weird. It looked like Somone took a chink of actual flesh out. Almost like it was a sack at one point? Im still bleeding and its weird looking blood. Way lighter then normal with a lot of mucus. 
If it was I was only 4 weeks along. I just went threw a very very harsh breakup and extreme amounts of stress. Maybe thats what did it? 
I also have endometriosis and am on my first month of birth control. Not sure if maybe it was just that? Im very confused and worried. Im not sure how well I explained this but im just scared and worried. I have pictures of whatever it was...really hoping it was a bad period.",t3_i95wsa
1287,Miscarriage,"Hi there - I’m on day 3 of recovering from my d&amp;c (which went as well as it could have) and the doctor’s office just called back that the tissue was normal and said this was good news for me and very reassuring. 

Except I don’t feel reassured at all, if anything I feel like this is cruel and that my body failed me, my husband and our future baby. If my embryo was normal, why did I miscarry? This is my first pregnancy/first MMC. Did anyone else get normal results after testing tissue? I didn’t ask to get the tissue tested, the doctor just made the call to do it and now I’m left feeling worse about everything 😞.",t3_i97phi
1288,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone, I just went through an early pregnancy loss and natural miscarriage, and throughout this process, I was so grateful for the opportunity to read about others’ experiences. I’m really terrible at coping with uncertainty, so I found it really helpful to search for posts from people at about my stage of pregnancy. I figured I might as well share my own experience, in case it is helpful to others for the same reason. All the gestational dates included below are based on my last monthly period. And to begin, given that you've found yourself reading this post, I am **so** sorry you've found yourself in this situation. Sending lots of love.

**tl;dr:**

* 4w5d: Positive pregnancy test after lots of early symptoms
* 4w6d onwards: Symptoms began to diminish
* 5w1d: Brown spotting started (continued until “real” bleeding began)
* 6w0d and 6w2d: Ultrasounds showing empty sac that looked like it was closer to 4 or 5 weeks
* 6w4d: Natural miscarriage began with heavy (but definitely bearable) cramping and bleeding
* 6w5d - 7w1d: A couple days of fairly heavy bleeding with a few half-dollar-sized clots, but nothing worse than the heavy days of my period
* 7w2d (today): Confirmed miscarriage was \[nearly\] complete (cervix closed and clean ultrasound, but will do a final HCG test in 2 weeks)
* Although emotionally difficult, physically everything was much easier than I anticipated

**The full story:**

My husband and I weren’t trying to conceive; although I’ve had baby fever for years, it’s been tough to figure out the “right time” to go for it, and with Covid (and a layoff my husband experienced as a result), we had been holding off on trying. Separately, I had recently told my husband that I was worried I’d have trouble conceiving whenever we did start trying, as I experience a lot of spotting leading up to my periods (progesterone issue?), so we had unprotected sex (a rarity for us) in July prior to what my Clue app listed as my fertile window without thinking much of it. When my period was a few days late (4w5d), I tested and got a strong positive. I also had a bunch of early pregnancy symptoms leading up to this point: breast soreness, white discharge, acne, super light uterine cramping, crazy mood swings. I tested again the next day and confirmed.

However, by the next evening (4w6d), I was pretty sure that my breast tenderness had decreased slightly. I did a ton of Googling to try to figure out if diminishing symptoms meant anything, but the answer seemed to be “it depends”. Over the next few days, all of the symptoms seemed to slowly dwindle (with the exception of a couple days in which I experienced nausea after eating, which led me to hold out hope). The uncertainty was driving me crazy—I was constantly poking my boobs to see if they still felt sore and reflecting on whether or not I *really* was nauseous. Late on 5w1d, I noticed the tiniest bit of tan color when wiping. and by 5w2d, I had noticeable brown spotting. Again, after lots of searching about what this might mean, the answer seemed to be “it depends”. The brown spotting continued, and thankfully, my OB was able to squeeze me in for an early appointment on 5w6d. (The night before the appointment, I noticed some bright red when wiping, though only for that moment, and it turned brown again.)

On 6w0d, I had an ultrasound that revealed an empty gestational sac. My OB shared that she thought it looked closer to 4 or 5 weeks, rather than 6, and said that maybe my dates were off. (Based on my cycle tracking, I was pretty sure that wasn’t the case, but held out hope.) She also tested my HCG (650) and progesterone (7.16) that day, which she mentioned were a bit low. She scheduled me for a follow-up appointment two days later (6w2d), and the sac was still empty, and though my HCG had increased slightly (766), my progesterone had dropped substantially (3.51). Until the end of the day on 6w3d, I was still spotting brown. She asked me to schedule a follow-up for one week later (7w2d) and let me know that I might begin to miscarry naturally before then, and that if I hadn’t by the next appointment we would discuss other options (miso/D&amp;C).

On 6w4d, I woke up to fairly strong cramps and moderate bleeding. Both of these were intermittent…they kind of came and went throughout the day. The bleeding picked up, and the next day (6w5d), it was heavier and more consistent. I passed 2-3 half-dollar-sized clots, but none of them was as large as I expected from reading others’ posts, and I never noticed that the (empty) gestational sac was passed, so I thought I still could have been waiting for the “main event.” Most of the cramping diminished after passing these clots, and the bleeding became more constant but a bit lighter.

Over the next few days (6w6d - 7w1d), the bleeding was light but consistent. I really only needed to change my overnight pad 2-3 times per day (and probably could have gone longer). Today (7w2d) I had my follow-up appointment with my OB, and she confirmed that my cervix was closed (manual exam) and my uterus was empty (transvaginal ultrasound), and my HCG had dropped to 85. Based on all of the above she let me know that she is nearly certain this was a complete miscarriage, though I’ll do a follow-up test in 2 weeks as a final confirmation. I am on pelvic rest (nothing inside vagina: no tampons, no vaginal sex) until the current bleeding completely stops, and she told me I can expect my next period in 30-60 days. She also mentioned that if we want to try again, we can do so after my next period finishes.

All in all, I wanted to share my experience because physically it was not nearly as horrible as I expected (I’m guessing because I was so early and the sac was empty). The bleeding never became as heavy as my periods, although I do have terribly heavy and clotty periods, so maybe that’s why it didn’t feel so bad? I also never experienced the single big “gush” that I read about from others, nor did I have a bleeding-through-multiple-pads-per-hour situation. Also, this is kind of weird, but given that I want to try for a natural childbirth when we do have a successful pregnancy, I thought I’d attempt to go through the miscarriage unmedicated to see what it was like, so I didn’t end up taking any pain meds. Every person and miscarriage are different, but for me and my miscarriage, at this point in my pregnancy, it turns out that this worked out just fine. The cramping was heavier than I ever experience with my periods, but it was never a sharp pain, just lots of uncomfortable pressure.

I'd be happy to answer any questions that anyone has about my experience, regardless of when in the future you might encounter this post.",t3_i97ftd
1289,Miscarriage,"I didn't know where else to post this but I desperately need advice. This post is going to contain details of what I've experienced so here's the trigger warning for that. 


I had been experiencing symptoms such as breast swelling and tenderness, increased appetite, nausea, bloating, I needed to pee more often, and my body just felt different. I put it down to my birth control. Due to my birth control I don't experience any bleeding at all, even periods and I haven't done for 6 years. 

Earlier this week I took a pregnancy test and it was negative. Later that day I started bleeding. It wasn't too heavy at first, but it was bright red fresh blood. I thought it was weird but shrugged it off. After this I had severe cramps, bad enough for me to cry. My boyfriend and I were in the car and I could feel wetness in my underwear. I told him I thought I was still bleeding from earlier. When we finally got home I went straight to the bathroom and my underwear was drenched with bright red blood. My legs were covered and the underwear and trousers were ruined. I sat on the toilet for a bit and the bleeding was still fairly heavy. From start to finish this was only about 2-4 hours but the amount of blood was far more than I'd ever experienced in a period. There were a fair amount of  big clots and I sat in the shower and cried for a bit because I was so scared I had no idea what was happening. 

In the days since that event I've had very mild spotting and bad cramping but no more heavy bleeding. What concerns me is that I no longer have any of the symptoms I thought were caused by birth control. My breasts aren't tender anymore, my appetite is normal, I don't feel sick, I don't pee as much. I can tell that there is something different. My body feels different to how it did before all the bleeding and cramps started. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't even know if I even was pregnant due to the close proximity of the test and the bleeding. I don't think a GP would be able to detect if I had a miscarriage now either. My boyfriend and I don't use condoms because we're exclusive and I'm on birth control but I know it isn't 100%. I guess I'm looking for any advice I can get?",t3_i95zbe
1290,Miscarriage,"I’m the dad. 

Today we are 18 weeks exactly. 
Today was a heartbeat scan. 
Today because of covid I wasn’t allowed to go with my wife so off I went to work as usual. 
Today we discovered he stopped growing at 15+5. 
And now we are in the hospital to give birth to our baby. 

Last October we miscarried at 6 weeks. 

Five years ago we lost a boy at 17+2. 

I don’t even know what to say or do or feel. Today I feel like I can’t do this again. Watching the sheer emotional distress of my wife for the baby we’ve longed for, for seven years. She did everything right but still blames herself. There is no way to comfort her. She’s strong right now but I know what’s coming because we’ve already done this. 

I don’t even know why I’m posting this. 

Three pregnancies and three losses. Seems cruel. Seems unfair.",t3_i8gzq7
1291,Miscarriage,"Hello. This is making me really anxious and paranoid and I dunno if it's valid to feel it at this moment. First week of July, I've had miscarriage which seems like a complete one since I bled heavily which lasted for two weeks. 

At the time, I didn't know I was pregnant and I just knew when the doctor made me take a PT and it showed a very faint positive. I was then requested to undergo ultrasound which later showed a non pregnant uterus and no fluid in the cul de sac. 

So after a week, I took a PT in my OBGYN's clinic and it turned out negative. My OB gave me pills to stop the bleeding which was already light that time. Took it for 7 days. After two days, I had my period with some tissues and clots still in it. It ended after 7 days so I went back to my doctor and she said, it was already my period and she prescribed pills for the next cycle.

Now, my current situation gives me so much anxiety because I am still easily feeling bloated and my tummy looks bigger than how it was before. I also feel some headaches and numbness on my left foot sometimes. Backpains and cramps are also present sometimes. I'm starting to really lose my mind because Idk if I'm still pregnant or if this is all normal.

Please help me ease my anxiety and tell me what your insights are. Thank you so much.",t3_i91yl7
1292,Miscarriage,"After my miscarriage at the end of January, I was told by a lot of well-meaning people that I would get pregnant easily in the first 3 months after the miscarriage. I had a doctor who said, ""at least you know you can get pregnant"", because he's a social nimrod. I had someone else tell me that I'm a powerful creator, like I should manifest a baby into my uterus. What every one of them failed to recognize is that no amount of pregnancies can ever heal that loss. Nothing will make my son's death okay, but *I'll be okay*. I can go on and live my life, and maybe I'll get pregnant, and maybe I won't, but it won't change that loss. This is a new road without him, and we'll find a new happiness that doesn't hinge on inserting another baby into our lives. We'll keep trying, but we'll prioritize the rest of our lives instead of two lines on a stick. I don't need to cage myself in a mental prison waiting for another baby to fix what can't be fixed. I would rather let things happen or not happen without hanging on to all of it so hard.",t3_i8k42a
1293,Miscarriage,I’m currently going through my second loss. In October I had a chemical and last week at 6 weeks I started spotting brown and my heart dropped. The brown turned to red and turned into a “period”. Doctor said cervix was still closed but now I feel the dreaded cramps. I feel so defeated. Bleeding and still have a positive pregnancy test with symptoms is such a cruel joke. I’m scared of trying again. I feel fearful of the future. This is just my vent . Laying here feeling the small life leave me is beyond unbearable. I feel so lost.,t3_i8xa0l

1296,Miscarriage,"I ran into target for a few things and as I was looking at the clothes, two women next to me were talking about their babies and children. One of the women had four children and the other had her newborn with her. 

What really hit me was when she said “It seems like I’m pregnant every other year.”

Maybe it’s because my baby would have been born two weeks ago... it’s just really hard right now. 

I feel like a failure as a woman sometimes, especially when I hear other women around me talking about how natural it comes to them.",t3_i8hwgy
1297,Miscarriage,Hello this keeps running through my mind when my partner went to the hospital at 17 weeks she had 2 ultrasounds  external and internal where both showed no heartbeat we later found out she had lost our child at 15 weeks they also took hcg which had rapidly declined the test that is really giving me headaches and making me scratch my head is that at this time she was passing blood clots so she had given them one to test at the time she went which was 17 weeks and they tested that clot and they said that showed that the baby had died at 15 weeks how is this done like I don’t understand like how would they know like it’s really confusing me does anyone know how they know that a child has passed after testing clots or am I asking this question in the wrong place I’m honestly just really confused .,t3_i8osex
1298,Miscarriage,"I had so much hope this time, I really did.

I went in for our 8 week ultrasound alone, because of Covid. I asked the ultrasound tech if I could take a video on my phone since my husband couldn’t be there, she said yes. We’ve had 2 previous losses and I was excited to show him a heartbeat. To hear a heartbeat myself.

She started with an external ultrasound and quickly said she needed to do a transvaginal (I expected this). 

As soon as she started, I put my phone away. There was a very small sac, and nothing more. No fetus, no flickering heartbeat, just empty.

“Are you sure about your dates?”

“I’m sure.”

“Are you feeling any pain?”

“No.”

“And you’re SURE your dates are correct?”

“YES.”

“We need to schedule a follow up right away.” 

And that was it. Wiped the gel off my stomach, walked to the front office, and walked to my car. And I’m assuming I’ll find out next steps on Friday at my follow up. Is it ectopic? Is it a blighted ovum? I don’t know. No one said. All I know is that I’m not instinctively holding my stomach anymore when I get up. I’m not hesitating when I pick up our puppy because she’s getting too heavy. I’m drinking because I’m not worried about hurting our fetus, because there is no fetus. There’s nothing. On one hand, I didn’t have to question it. There’s nothing there this time.

And I’m so tired. I’m physically exhausted. I’m emotionally spent. I wish we hadn’t told anyone, even if we only told a few people, because I’m tired of disappointing everyone. I’m tired of failing. For the third time in saying, I’m so sorry to tell you this but it’s another loss. I’m so sorry. I don’t know what happened.

I’m still feeling pregnancy symptoms and I’m so mad. It just doesn’t feel okay.",t3_i8od2j
1299,Miscarriage,"We have been trying to get pregnant for a couple of years now. Got the good news end of June. First appointment at Week 8 was great; saw the baby and heard its heartbeat over Facetime (only wife could go in due to damn COVID). Second appointment; no heartbeat, nothing. Doctor said baby stopped growing 1.5 weeks ago. Wife had D&amp;C today and can’t stop crying since. I think it hit her after the procedure. 

We desperately wanted a baby and had our dream come true for 2 months. Then bam! Everything gone in a second. Not sure why I’m posting this.",t3_i8o3h4
1300,Miscarriage,"We just got the results of genetic testing and they said Turner’s Syndrome so my Dr. is confident it was just bad luck. However she brought up that they did more in depth testing and found a chromosomal duplication which doesn’t cause miscarriage but does cause brain abnormalities. And the genetic people said they recommend further testing to rule out hereditary issues for that. She said not too worry too much about issues there, plus my husband has no genetic or developmental problems at all on his side so it was surprising. Anyone else run into something like this? I’ll be talking to a genetic counselor this week. 

Side note, kind of sad to find out it was a girl because that’s what I was imagining the baby was, I know I shouldn’t want one gender over another but really hoping for another girl next time.",t3_i8puez
1301,Miscarriage,"Back story: I’m 24 and this is my first pregnancy (unplanned). Earlier this year I had my right ovary and tube removed due to a giant teratoma. It has been rough, but my doctor said I’m perfectly healthy and am as fertile as ever with one ovary. Well, shocker...I get pregnant the month after my surgery. 

Timeline:
I took a plan b on the 7th of July after unprotected sex on the 4th (fireworks weren’t the only thing exploding that night)
I started lightly spotting on the 20th which never got heavier so I took an at home test on the 21st which was positive. I had sore nipples and bloated, but the spitting scared me. It turned into a gross brown discharge that was THICK and looked like coffee grounds...(google says miscarriage is in the works) well I started bleeding and having painful cramps on the 25th. Was sure I was miscarrying. Called my doc and went to take a test and the test came back negative on the 27th so I assumed I completed my miscarriage. So I schedule to get an IUD on the 30th....surprise! POSITIVE TEST 3 DAYS LATER! So they did blood work. I told my doc I had been bleeding and had painful cramps (way more than a period) she believed me when I told her I thought I was miscarrying, but the truth lies in the blood work. My 1st hCG 07/30 came back at 345(8 weeks pregnant, super low) went back 48 hours later 08/01....HCG at 304 (confirmed dropping means miscarriage...too slow or a drop for my doc to feel good. Did another hCG on the 8/03 and it was down to 190. I had passed what looked like the pregnancy sac and all my cramping stopped and my pregnancy symptoms disappeared. GREAT LETS GET THIS OVER WITH! My doctor wanted to continue to do bloodwork every week until my numbers were below 5....so on 08/10 my HCG went up to 232....WTF? Dr. thinks it could be ectopic...I only have one tube left...I don’t feel like there is enough haste...I need answers now! I have a scan due on Friday the 14th and blood work the day prior.
EDIT****had another blood draw today 08/13, quant was at 108. So back down to less than half of what it was 3 days ago. Not sure what to think. 

Also, I have been bleeding for about 20 days (started 25th of July)

ANYONE, has this happened to you? Any advice? I feel like I have no control over my body anymore. Ectopic experiences WELCOME.

UPDATE*** going in for hopefully my last HCG quant test today. Went in  08/14 to do a transvaginal ultrasound. Still bleeding, still unsure. And to my complete surprise everything looked normal. My uterus looked normal! No thick lining or anything that needed to come out. Now onto my one ovary and tube...NORMAL! nothing unusual here folks. So my doctor is as baffled as I am at how my quants were all over the place! We are doing one last quant tests today and if my number hasn’t dropped significantly, I will be given methotrexate to rid my body of any lingering cells. WHAT A ROLLERCOASTER.",t3_i8pstt
1302,Miscarriage,"Wow- did not expect to make an appearance in this sub, as I am sure all of you didnt, but so, so glad this community exists. My husband and I tried for a year, started working with an RE, and thought we had a pregnancy this month. 

I had beta hcg done 13 days past trigger and levels were 731, second beta today, at 15dpo or 4w1d went down to 526. I had a gut feeling this entire month that something wasn't right. I have had lower right side mild pain/ discomfort (constant, feel discomfort when straining, stretching or applying pressure, not awful, but uncomfortable also feel like I have a UTI) for a few days that I told myself after a lot of reading was probably a corpus luteum cyst. After today's bloodwork, I know that isnt the case.

I am going in tomorrow for an ultrasound to rule out ectopic and more bloodwork, and a rhogam shot. it is my understanding with HCG being this low, nothing will be seen in the ultrasound, not sure why they are doing an ultrasound? 

This cycle being monitored means I am taking progesterone, my doctor wants me to keep taking the progesterone until tomorrow in case the first reading was an error (I paid out of pocket for a private lab HCG). This option is pretty unlikely.

Does anyone have a similar experience? Given my HCG levels dropping so fast, I would imagine I'll begin to miscarry soon?",t3_i8ksyg

1305,Miscarriage,"I just had my miscarriage on Saturday (found out last Tuesday at 8 weeks and took the medication over the weekend). By then, we had been looking forward to the first ultrasound and had been buying books, starting a registry, constantly googling stuff and downloading pregnancy apps. Naturally, all the targeted ads on every website and app became pregnancy/baby related. Suggested items on Amazon are now all baby monitors, breast pumps and bottles. It's relentless and it's everywhere, and is a constant reminder of our loss. I can avoid social media to stop seeing pregnancy announcements and baby pictures, but the targeted ads are inescapable.

1306,Miscarriage,"Hi all,
I recently had two positive pregnancy tests when my period was a day overdue. I had taken the test because my breasts were sore and I'd had implantation bleeding.

One was a clear blue digital test and the other was a first response. The next day I had a negative test I thought maybe I was just very early. Then in the night I had stabbing pains in my groin. Following that day I started bleeding heavy with clots, and abdominal pain unlike a period. 

My doctor seems to think it was a chemical pregnancy and period. However, I'm in a bit of pain and the bleeding is pretty heavy. Kind of gushes when I go to toilet and lots of clots. 

I haven't had any advice. Unsure of what to do or what this means really. 

Thanks in advance.

Any advice would help.",t3_i8dodd
1307,Miscarriage,I went into urgent care on Sunday due to some spotting. They took some blood and told me to monitor it. Well today I went in to give more blood so they could test my hcg levels but my bleeding got worse and I started cramping as well. Passing blood clots too. Doctor called me to tell me they hadn’t received the results from second blood test yet but that my levels from the first were very very low (104). Because of this and my symptoms she said it’s most likely a miscarriage. I’m devastated. I go in between waves of feeling like it’s going to be okay to just sobbing. I’m not sure what to expect. Will the cramping get worse? I’d compare it to a heavy period right now. I just feel so sad and empty.,t3_i88900
1308,Miscarriage,Confirmed with my doctor we are no longer pregnant and waiting for the miscarriage to start. I’m heartbroken but also feel like I knew something was off this time. She said the sac is measuring small at like 4 weeks now and shrinking? I guess that’s a thing. I had my only appointment at 6w5d and she said she saw perfect sac and heartbeat on a bedside ultrasound so I’m confused how that can be seen then by 9 weeks be gone and shrinking. I have to wait till next week for a d&amp;c so hopefully this bleeding starts and I can get through this and we’ll be able to try again.,t3_i7x0ec

How long should it take to get going? I feel like it should have started by now. I am just so over this and want it gone so I can move forward. I’m 36 (37 next month) and don’t want to delay three cycles to try again. So frustrated. I had a previous miscarriage last August at 5.5 weeks and went through similar beta hell, but I had already started miscarrying by now. I’m just worried this is taking too long.",t3_i7zy3h
1310,Miscarriage,"I’m 34 yo and found out at my 12 week appointment last Tuesday that my baby no longer had a heartbeat (it died sometime in the 11th week).  I had a D&amp;C the next day. 

This was a planned pregnancy and my first one.  I had told my counselor about the pregnancy (I’m in counseling due to depression), my niece’s mom, and my supervisor (because morning sickness had been kicking my ass). 

Regarding the miscarriage, I have told several close friends, my niece’s mom, my supervisor, and my mom.  

I am still struggling and want to be able to tell others.  I highly doubt my boyfriend has told anyone, though he did take off work to be there for my surgery.  I brought up telling his parents last week and he said he “didn’t want to upset them”. His dad has anxiety and also they are dealing with financial worries right now.  

That kind of pissed me off.  I’M the one who is upset and needs support at this time.  However, it’s kind of like Pandora’s box, once you reveal a secret, you can’t put it back. 

We are also close friends with two couples whom we haven’t told.  We’re practically family, their kids call us aunt and uncle.  We have a group chat but I don’t know if that’s the place to bring it up or if my boyfriend even would feel comfortable with it. 

I got so mad at him last night at him because he said he’s had a hard week.  

I calmed down a bit when he explained. He said he has been having a hard time juggling everything. He took on a lot because I had morning sickness and didn’t feel like doing much.  Now I’m on restricted activity for 3 more weeks. He’s been under a lot of pressure at work, two of our cats have been ill, the stuff with his parents, and then comforting me all the time and being strong for me.  The pregnancy was more real for me than it was for him since I was the one dealing with all the changes and hormones.

1314,Miscarriage,"I did not sleep at all last night, which was to be expected after the anxiety that was increasing on the days leading up to my return to work. I lost my baby at 6 + 2 in the public bathroom stall. I was all alone because I had left my phone in my office and couldn't leave the bathroom or call anyone in to help.

I work in a male dominated profession and at the time didn't feel like there was anyone I could explain the situation to without absolutely losing my mind and having to be carried out of there. Instead I cleaned myself up, put my hard hat on and dissapeared to a quiet place until it was time to go home. I now realize that it was my right to get out of there and to get to a loved one who could hold me while I grieved but honestly I just couldn't stand the thought of explaining the situation to anyone and have them look at me differently when I came back. It would have been another constant reminder of what had happened to me. No one at work knew I was pregnant and so no one knows the pain I'm in, it turns out I'm just good at pretending everything is okay. 

I must've stared at that bathroom stall for at least an hour today just letting the grief and memory wash over me. Somehow I kept it together all day until just now when I got home and I'm proud of myself for that. I hope tomorrow it gets easier and easier the day after that. I hope that if this ever happens to me again I have the courage to speak up and say that I'm not okay and that I need help. I mostly hope I never have to go through this again but there's always a chance isn't there? 

Even though I would never wish anything like this on even my worst enemy, I am so glad I found this sub. I'm thankful to know that I am not alone and that it's sadly a very common thing but something I can bounce back from.

1316,Miscarriage,"After 6 months of TTC, I got pregnant in January. We had two OB appointments end of February and March that went great— saw a heartbeat, everything looked good.

Covid hit our city hard two weeks later, and I called my OB asking for an appointment— my job was now remote and my husband and I wanted to protect the baby by going to stay in a more rural area but we wanted to check in on the baby first. 

I knew something was wrong instantly when the doctor immediately turned the ultrasound screen away from me. He then said there was no heartbeat anymore. He said we needed to deal with it quickly with misoprostol. 

I won’t go into too many details but the next 24 hours were incredibly gruesome and traumatic for both me and my husband. I threw up from pain, delivered the baby and placenta in the bathtub whole, it was awful, it took 2 more rounds of misoprostol and 1 month to finish off the miscarriage, we did not leave our city as a result.

I’m now 5 months out from this experience and it still haunts me. I miss my baby. I have constant disturbing memories torment me of the dr appointment and the delivery. I feel like I can’t get through the day without sobbing.

My period was two weeks late, I decided to take a test, thinking that a negative result would speed up my always irregular period.
When it was positive, I nearly passed out. I panicked, my whole body was shaking. I was worried that I’m broke, trying to go back to college, I’m not with my baby’s daddy and I’m not ready - I still live at home. 
I considered not having my baby for a day, discussed it with my Mom and friends and then realised that this is all I’ve ever wanted. I told the daddy and of course he panicked, but we were so so so excited. That night we picked out a name and god parents.
Also that night.. I went to bed, I was awake for 5 hours in pain. I convinced myself that this was my Endo covered womb making allowances for new life. I had a small bleed. I googled and came to the conclusion that this was normal.
I lay awake, downloading apps for figuring out what size my baby is. I was 5 weeks.
I slept for an hour. I woke up in agony and my whole world came crashing down.
I went to the hospital, I wanted to punch every poor doctor that came near me.
I had to repeat to every member of staff that I was having a miscarriage. They wouldn’t confirm it for days until the blood work came back.
I passed the pregnancy when I went to go to the toilet. I was holding it in tissue, knowing what it was, and part of me was still hoping the confirmation wouldn’t come back from the doctors.
I bought a little wooden box, wrote a note, added a flower and buried my pregnancy with its Daddy.
Now I’m 26, me and the Daddy are in a committed relationship, it’s brought us so much closer. it’s been 5 months and I’m still not me. I don’t want to be pregnant, I’m still not ready. But I wanted that one. That one was mine.

Moral of the story is, it’s very hard being a single 25 y/o girl who had a miscarriage and longs for the baby she lost when she doesn’t want to try again and all of her friends have no idea how much she is hurting.",t3_i786ot
1318,Miscarriage,"Found out at my 16w ultrasound that we lost our little girl. Completed a D&amp;C the next day. Since then, I have been incredibly sad and feeling like I failed my daughter. Sent her off to pathology and for chromosomal testing. Even though I know it’s illogical, I worry that she is all alone. I feel I am a mother without a baby in my arms. How long does the guilt and sadness last? Has anything helped you? Anyone know of resources for dads?",t3_i7eaoe
1319,Miscarriage,"I went for my 8 week ultrasound on Friday July 17. I wasn’t shown a heartbeat and I knew something was up. My doctor said the dates could be off and I was hopeful. I still had pregnancy symptoms but they faded slowly by the follow up ultrasound at 10.5 weeks, last Wed August 5. The tech didn’t show me the heartbeat and said there was no change from the last scan.  For 4.5 weeks our baby had left us already. 

It’s been devastating. My last semester of school was cancelled bc of the pandemic, they started a small cohort of my class early and I used my pregnancy to get a spot so I could finish by the end of September (I’m becoming a nurse practitioner so we need to be in clinics/hospitals/etc). I’m taking a week off placement, but I’m thinking about getting a note for 2 weeks. 

I’m 35 and I’ve had 3 abortions (over 13 years ago) when I was I was young. I didn’t want to do a d &amp; c again bc of that and opted for the miso. My last d &amp; c for termination they didn’t remove all the tissue so I had to take miso, so I was familiar. I had large clots pass over a week later back then. The miso now I took last Friday, was intense but I have gotten through the worst of it. I had no idea the clots I would pass would be that large. I passed at least 3 clots the size of my fist and even more smaller ones. 

I am having intense pain in my uterus (4-5/10), no fever, chills, or weakness. After my previous d &amp; cs I was ok after a day of rest. But I was also younger. I have literally been horizontal and going to stay that way for a few days.  My partner has been supporting me greatly. He’s literally doing everything and every time I cry he comes and holds me and he cries too.  We’re also just watching lots of dumb television so that helps. We are waiting to get through this to TTC and while I’m eager I’m also scared and intimidated of trying again. I want to focus on us and not get lost in this even though I engage in some unhealthy self blame. 

I have a couple of questions
- has anyone here had an abortion then MC and conceived again? 
- how long was your recovery time if you took miso?",t3_i7lht1

1321,Miscarriage,"I had a miscarriage in November 2019 at 7 weeks. It was my first pregnancy but my fiancé and I had been having unprotected sex for about a year prior.

My sister just had a healthy baby and 6 of my friends are pregnant right now. I feel so hopeless.. I know I need to focus on getting healthy but it’s hard.

1322,Miscarriage,"I went for my first ultrasound on July 28 when I should have been 9w4d. Had to use the fancy ultrasound machine and found that baby was measuring at 6w1d and no heartbeat. July 31 I believe my body passed the sac on its own. Honestly so much blood in the toilet I really couldn’t tell. I sat on the toilet for about 2.5 hours consistently passing clots and bleeding. The only times I tried to get up I immediately soaked a pad so I just hung out there to be safe. It started slowing down and finally about 3 hours later I could go on with being up and moving around. 

I have had spotting and very very light bleeding since then. Today right when I got home from work I could tell my pad was soaked before making it the bathroom. I had just used the restroom before leaving work and there was light spotting and my drive home is less than 10 min. I got to the bathroom and found that I was passing some pretty big clots again and I had been having cramps the past couple of days. I stayed on the toilet experiencing the same things I had before, but it only lasted about 40 min and slowed down. I have been able to go on about my day and just go to the restroom about every 15 min to check and it’s just like a normal period at this point, light if anything. 

Was my MC not complete in July? Is this my period starting and my body is just passing some remnants from the pregnancy? I’m not sure what to think of this, I was fine with the spotting, but that heavy bleeding and clotting made me feel like I was going through my MC all over again.",t3_i7g59p

1325,Miscarriage,"I had my first ultrasound today. I would have been 12 weeks exactly today. About an hour ago I found out that I had a MMC, and the baby was only measuring 7 weeks. No heartbeat. I've been having all the first trimester pregnancy symptoms of nausea and all. Three days ago I started to develop dizziness which happens around week 12. No spotting. No bleeding throughout. I thought the Gods had finally blessed me. I have never had a positive pregnancy test in my life. Even for this pregnancy, I tested at 9 weeks because I just couldn't believe it was happening for me. Blood HCG at nine weeks was very much within range and at a good healthy level. It feels like a cruel joke the universe played on me. 

I informed my manager that I'll be taking the day off today. I told her about the miscarriage but have asked her to keep it to herself. 

I was looking forward to crossing into trimester two. I've been trying for over 4 years now. No children. I had given up to be honest and this pregnancy was a surprise. I didn't announce the pregnancy to anyone in my family or friend circle as I was scared of disappointing them. Today morning I dreamt of a successful 12 week ultrasound, where I heard a heartbeat of healthy baby and I dreamt that I finally told my parents, and they were so happy and excited. I took that as a good omen. This would have been their first grandchild.

1326,Miscarriage,"I'm seeking advice here because I currently live in a country that apparently isn't proactive with maternal care. I saw the doctor today and they took blood work, but won't listen for a heartbeat or do imaging, etc. They will do more blood work in 3 days to compare. 

I'm 12 weeks pregnant and started bleeding yesterday, light at first, a little heavier today, bright red and some brown. I have no pain right now, just sadness and some anger at the healthcare system here and the incompetency of my doctor. When I saw my doctor today, she took an HcG level, but apparently this is the first one they have taken the whole pregnancy so I cannot compare to anything. Awaiting the results now. If it is a missed miscarriage that I am experiencing, would the HcG level today reflect that? 

Also, for those who have been through a miscarriage (or bleeding) at/around 12 weeks, would you be willing to share how it was for you and what helped? The typical way they do it here is to let the miscarriage happen naturally, but I may be able to advocate for something else if I know what to ask for and what to expect.",t3_i73byq

1331,Miscarriage,"Yesterday I started having my first miscarriage. I was 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. I woke up feeling very unwell, faint, sick and so weak I could hardly stand. I had an odd sensation across my pelvis and twinges of pain. I didn't feel right at all, so I called the out of hours service and said I felt that something was wrong. They completely dismissed me and told me to drink more water.

A few hours later the bleeding started. It came on so suddenly and got heavy quickly. I went to the early pregnancy unit, where I had to wait in a waiting room for ages. Then they told me to come back in a week's time for a scan. I have to wait a week to be told what I already know, that my baby is dead. When I got home, the bleeding got much worse and I was soaking through pads. Had to sleep with one of those incontinence massive pads on and a towel underneath me so I didn't keep wrecking stuff. Every time I went to the toilet, it and my toilet roll were covered in the brightest red blood I've ever seen. 

I've just woken up (8am here in the UK), and I feel so sad and empty inside. I cried pretty much all afternoon and night yesterday, I feel like I have no tears left. I also feel like an idiot as I had literally just told all my friends.

1332,Miscarriage,"Potential trigger warning:

TL/DR: my wife is becoming obsessive, verbally abusive while we cope with miscarriages.

I'm sorry if anything I say is triggering to anyone. I (36m) have a wife (36f) from the Philippines. Her entire life before me, she was unable to get pregnant. She thought she had a felopian tube blockage or something, but was never 100% sure. Then we got married, and came back to the states. Just before all of this COVID stuff, she had her first pregnancy. We were overjoyed of course, because we had resigned to the idea of never having children, and being ""team do whatever we want"".

However, she miscarried 8 weeks in, before she could even get in to see a doctor.  Not long after, she was pregnant again. And again, miscarried at 8 weeks. This is the 3rd pregnancy, so we had her on self-perscribed bed rest immediately until we could get her to an OB/GYN. However, COVID has all hospitals on a very long lag time.  She's miscarrying now, again at 8.5 weeks. ER told us to stay home and allow it to happen naturally, because they couldn't do anything anyway, and it could needlessly expose us to COVID.

My wife has been obsessively throwing her time into facebook groups, forums, articles; she's on amazon looking for progesterone supplements, baby dopplers... it all started after the first miscarriage.

I can't stop her obsessing, and she threatened to divorce me if I don't give her a baby. I don't understand this one particular behavior, and while I am also heartbroken over these losses, I've been trying so hard to be strong for her, but I know when this miscarriage is ""completed"", she's going to throw more threats my way.

I need to find some way to comfort her. I don't know what to do. I'm so brokenhearted over these miscarriages like her, but she throws these threats at me while I'm trying to show her I'm here for her and never going to stop trying. She keeps hurting me, and I'm doing my best to just shake it all off to stay on task...

1334,Miscarriage,"I had a miscarriage on July 17th at 5wks along, my husbands and I had been trying for 9 months and were crushed. It’s been a few weeks now, my tests turned negative and life has essentially gone on even though it’s always in my mind that I’ve had a miscarriage and terribly miss my little nugget (that was our nickname we gave it).

So today, a package arrives and my husband asks me to open it with him because he ordered it. I open up this little package and there’s 2 small, cement statues one of a man of Asian descent with a red bib on and another of a man of Asian descent holding a small baby tightly to his chest smiling. So I’m confused then my husband tells me: He found this story on Reddit about a Japanese/Buddhist tradition called a “Jizo statue” the statue is of a Saint whose name is Jizo and he’s the patron saint of unborn children. In both Buddhist and Christian beliefs, unborn children haven’t accrued enough good karma/been baptized so when they die, they don’t go to heaven they go to limbo. Well it’s believed Saint Jizo puts all the unborn children in his pocket and sneaks them into heaven so that they are able to be reunited with their parents one day but you have to let him know that you have had an unborn child so in Japan, they put these little statues outside of their house so that Jizo will be able to collect their unborn child and deliver it to heaven. 

He tells me this and my entire heart just melts. There is no real way to honor or memorialize unborn children because there’s no body to bury or funeral to have and I think that plays a huuuuuge role in the mental affect it has of those of us who have to experience it. This tradition and this Jizo statue has given me so much comfort and closure already, so I wanted to pass this along to anyone who may be looking for a similar way to memorialize their baby that never got to be. ❤️

1336,Miscarriage,"I have an appointment with my family doctor on Tuesday but just wanted to hear if any of you have had similar experiences? Or maybe any ideas of what else it could be. Sorry in advance for the length and tmi.

So the start of my last period was June 16th, mid July, I noticed I was very nauseous at random times, a tad moodier and my migraines were worse than usual. Typically when I feel pms symptoms I check my tracking app to see when to expect blood, upon opening it I saw that I was 11 days late. I am super regular, any time I've been late it has been 3 days max aside from once where it was 5. I bought a pregnancy test that was negative but figured it was too early and that I would wait it out before trying again. As time went on I started feeling extremely bloated, my nausea was worsening and I was beginning to experience mood swings, my breasts were also super sore. There was one night where I NEEDED Kraft dinner and hotdogs, cried when we didn't have it, walked to the store and promptly ate the whole box...I took another negative test.

 I kept tabs on what week I'd be in and my symptoms were matching exactly, there were about 2-3 weeks where I knew I was pregnant but I kept getting negative tests so I scheduled a blood test which again was negative. 

Suddenly when I wouldve been between 7-8 weeks there was a day at work where I felt normal again and was surprised because I'd felt disgusting the weeks prior, before my shift ended I started spotting bright pink and put a pad on. When I got home I experienced debilitating pain in my lower stomach and lower back, I couldn't even walk I just collapsed in pain until I passed out, this is when I started bleeding heavily. The next couple days were filled with heavy bleeding and I was passing tissue. 

I tried to wait it out for my appointment but on day 3 I was feeling awfully dizzy so I called health link to speak with an RN and then spoke with my family doctor, both advised me to go to the hospital. I followed their instructions but upon recieving another negative blood test I was sent away without them even letting me explain my symptoms. My S.O took me to a medicenter where I was given an urgent referral for am ultrasound but I have to wait until tomorrow to schedule it.

So I initially bled for 3 days, it stopped yesterday and it started again today, I'm having sharp pains in my lower left abdomen, I'm pale, most of the blood comes out only when I pee and I feel like absolute garbage. I know the tests were negative but I also know my body and I am 99% sure I've had a miscarriage,  2 nurses agreed with me as well. 

Have any of you experienced negative pregnancy tests but were actually pregnant? Or have any of you had a similar instance where it turned out to be something else entirely? I'm so scared and any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated as I await my appointment and try not to worry about getting sepsis or hemorrhaging.",t3_i6v09g

We were terrified even though we are both in our 30s but once we got used to the idea we were so excited.

1339,Miscarriage,"Hello reddit. I don’t have anywhere or anyone I feel comfortable sharing with in my life, so thank you for setting a space where I can do it here. 


I just had my D&amp;C yesterday (friday) after getting an ultrasound wednesday that showed neither of my twins had a heartbeat and both had stopped growing. I should’ve been around my 10th week. 

I think I’m still in shock about it all, and I’m trying to put on a brave face for my husband. 

But, it’s so so hard.

It was my first pregnancy. I had my first ultrasound around 8 weeks, and there was no heartbeat. I’ve always had irregular periods, so my doctor just thought maybe I was earlier than I estimated, and scheduled me for a follow up ultrasound. For this one, she got very very quiet (that’s never a good sign, I learned....) and told me to get a fancier ultrasound at the hospital that same afternoon.  

Welllll in this one, the technician told me that I had twins and that neither had a heartbeat. They were both gone. 

My doctor immediately scheduled me for a D&amp;C. Because it was under short notice, my doctor couldn’t do it herself. Another doctor did it, and it was awful. I combed through reddit and other sources beforehand to try to mentally prepare for it, but nothing I read talked about it being an painful experience, so I wasn’t prepared at all. 

In case this can help someone else (or warn someone else, so they can talk through it with their doctor to make sure they are more prepared than I was), this was the process: 

I was given a pill meant to soften my crevix the night before. That was fine, but I wasn’t warned that it gives you diarrhea the whole night before (welp!). I was also told to take 800mg of advil and 400 mg of tylenol about an hour before my appointment. At my appointment, I was given a xanax beforehand. I never took xanax before, so that was interesting - just got sleepy very quickly. Unfortunately the sleepy feeling didn’t really last or get me through the procedure. 

The doctor recommended I get an IV for pain. I don’t know if it was an anomaly, but the doctor couldn’t find my veins to give me an IV — and she didn’t end up hooking up an IV to me at all. (today i just have an ugly bruise on my arm to show for it) I’m not actually sure I got the full pain medication i should’ve gotten in retrospect. 

The dilation process was extremely uncomfortable and hurt, but what was really terrible was when they turned on the vacuum. It felt like really really bad cramps. The whole process was only about 20 minutes but I was sobbing from pain throughout. I’m usually a stiff upper lip kinda person when it comes to pain, but I was a mess. I kept thinking that of course labor would be much, much worse, and I shouldn’t be such a wimp — but there’s just something so awful mentally about the pain leading to just...nothingness. 

After the procedure, I was told to just watch out for heavy bleeding. I am supposed to take a medication to flush out anything that is left in my uterus, and to expect some light bleeding. 

My doctor told me she would prescribe me some medication to flush out any remnants in my uterus (drug meant to cause cramping) as well as some antibiotics to prevent infection. She must have ended up forgetting, because my pharmacy told me they never got a prescription. Because I had the procedure on a Friday, no ones been answering my calls about the medicine since Friday afternoon. I’m hoping I’ll be able to get a call back - any my prescription- in Monday. 

All in all, I was just so utterly unprepared and feel so beaten up in different ways. I don’t feel like I can share this with my family or friends because I haven’t told anyone I was pregnant yet (was advised to wait until 2nd trimester) — i guess the flip side of not having to tell people you miscarried is not having people to tell you miscarried. 

Anyway, I’m sorry this was long and a bit of a downer. I really hope my experience helps someone else have a better (if there is such a thing) one.",t3_i6cstw

I opted for a D&amp;C which was performed under general anesthesia the next day.  That day and the following day I had very light bleeding and a sore throat from intubation.  On Friday my bleeding was a little heavier with some cramping.  

Today I was passing large clots and my pain was up to around a 6 or 7.  I tried to get by on half a Tramadol but went up to the maximum dose (75 mg).

I’ve had the Nexoplan implant in for 2 and a half years now (due to be removed Jan 2021) and have had very little bleeding/spotting since having it put in. 

In March, I started bleeding as if it was a normal period, however this lasted for a week or 2 and went away, which I thought was normal. 

On the 20th of July, I started with very heavy bleeding and with big clots coming out and it’s still happening now with less clots. 

About a week in, I spent 3-5 days with very bad cramps, headaches and sickness, again thinking this is normal side effects of the implant. 

I took 2 pregnancy tests 3 days ago, one came out positive the other negative. I took 2 more tonight and they both came out negative. Looking it up online, I can see that this could be a miscarriage. I was hoping anyone would be able to advise me on what this could be, if it’s normal for the implant side effects and what to do next or even if anyone has had a similar experience. 

I can’t currently see a doctor for around 3 weeks as I’m self isolating.",t3_i6d4pi
1345,Miscarriage,"It’s been a week since I had my d &amp; c and I feel as if nothing has gone my way since. I don’t necessarily think that nothing’s gone my way since but it’s more like something goes wrong and it hits me a little harder or I take even more personal. It’s like I can go somewhere and they get my order wrong and I’ll get so angry I want to cry or something I really wanted is closed and I want to cry because I was so excited. I know in my head that it has nothing to do with me but in my heart it’s like wow I can never win. This is my second miscarriage. The first one I was very early on so I was never able to even see my baby and eventually it just passed on it’s own. This second time I was further a long and I got to see my baby and hear the heart beat that when I found out what had happen it was absolutely devastating and I just could not believe it was happening again.  It hurts so bad. I have a son and so I have to stay positive for him but some days I just wish I could just lay in my bed all day and when I feel pain in my body it just reminds of what I’m going through. But anyways that’s my story about how I feel the world is against me. If anyone would like to share or just add one don’t be afraid, we’re not alone in this.",t3_i6cm2v
1346,Miscarriage,"Hello everyone, I just want to start by saying I found this sub during my actual miscarriage because it was so hard to find real experience MC info online that could explain what was happening and what to expect and it really helped through the whole process to read your stories. I felt so lost with all the info BC I was having such a painful experience and online it was equating it to a heavy period but coming here really showed the diversity of the MC experience. 

I started bleeding on July 1 of this year following a missed miscarriage diagnosis on June 16, and confirmed on June 29. I passed a clot the size of maybe a plum...on July 4 and bled until July 9. This was my first pregnancy. I was measuring at 7 weeks and the actual miscarriage happened at like week 10. I came off birth control in January of this year...so we had a fairly fast conception considering. 

I had blood tests done and my midwife said my levels had dropped from 4000 to 500 within a week and she was unconcerned of a molar pregnancy etc and that I could continue life as normal, through conversation with her opting for the ""if it happens it happens"" and not waiting for my first period to start having unprotected sex. 

My problem is that I'm a hyper planner....and this whole experience (from weird cycle stuff after coming off Birth control after taking it for 10 years to the pregnancy itself to the loss to now trying again...) Is very hard because of the....unknown aspect and patience required. It's also hard BC my in-law family is so excited for us to have a child eventually (our families were not told of the pregnancy nor miscarriage) and all the grandchildren from two other couples were all conceived by accident while the mothers were on birth control. It makes me feel sad....and jealous. Like my planning and control over my fertility over the years is now coming to bite me in the ass. I logically know this isn't true but emotionally it's a struggle. 

I read online that some women ovulate after 2 weeks...that your period should come 4 to 6 weeks later. But with terms like early miscarriage and late miscarriage and conflicting beliefs and such I don't know what to expect. 

When do you ovulate? When your hormone levels come to zero/negative pregnancy test? Or is it random? 

At 4 weeks passed my MC(last week) I took a pregnancy test that showed a very faint line. And online it said early miscarriage should have hormones gone in a week or two. Other people say a month. So is it possible this was still from the MC even though a week after I had dropped from 4k to 500?  I was pretty hopeful and excited.

I took another pregnancy test this morning, now 5 weeks from MC and it appears negative. So I can only assume that's what the previous was BC I still had hormone leftover. But now that I've had a negative is there any indication of when I will ovulate, or when my period will come? 

I feel like I've read every article there is to read. 

Thanks for taking the time to read. It's nice to know you're actually not alone and you're not just a statistic rattled off in an article. &lt;3 much love and happiness to everyone.",t3_i5xhj3

1348,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone,

I am currently going through a miscarriage at 4 weeks 5 days.  This was my first pregnancy. It was expected (low HCG levels and spotting earlier in the week) but I’m upset.  Any tips on how to stay distracted and comfortable while this happens? I have a lot of cramping and blood. I spoke with the midwife and there’s nothing I can do unless the bleeding reaches an unhealthy level. 

Thank you for the help!",t3_i5yq78
1349,Miscarriage,"Hi all. I know this isn’t a medical advice sub but I haven’t gotten much luck in the past.
I had my first miscarriage last year - it was a silent miscarriage at nearly 13 weeks.
When the miscarriage physically happened (it was eventually natural) it was very clear what was going on. I had contractions, having bleeding, and sorry if TMI - I was stuck on the toilet for hours also having to poo. It was a lot of heartbreak and I haven’t fully recovered mentally yet.

This time around however, I’m very confused.
I’ve started some spotting on July 20th - to then have what I thought was my period on July 26th. It was definitely red and abundant.
Bleeding never really stopped, although after 4-5 days it went back to spotting.
I only had cramps the first day and a bit of my period.
Because the spotting came back heavier recently (without ever stopping) I’ve contacted my GP (I’m in the UK if it’s relevant) - which just said it happens, asked me if I was particularly stressed (which currently I’m not) and that it’s just normal and due to this this month I probably won’t ovulate.
However I wanted to check that, so I peed on an ovulation test, which was very much positive.
Because we’re TTC, I had a few PT hanging around. After the first tested positive I took 2 more (2 different brands together). All positive.
The trouble is, after this, the GP only said it was impossible I was pregnant (miscarriage wasn’t even mentioned) but then after several calls back and forth agreed to a blood test - the first was only available 2 days ago.

In the past few days I’ve experienced again redder bleeding and more cramps - whilst I didn’t have symptoms between my “period” and a few days ago.
The first positive PT was taken this past Monday and I’ve tested positive every day since.
I know it doesn’t necessarily mean I’m pregnant, I also don’t have any other symptoms to indicate that, but I’ve been unable to understand if I actually was or if something else could cause the PPT.

I won’t have the blood results until next week. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right sub, or haven’t given enough info, I’m just currently not sure on what to do.
I’m afraid that in the slightest chance I might be pregnant I could do something I shouldn’t (take the wrong pain killer, train a little too hard, say yes to the glass of wine my mom offers when I see her, or maybe just a coffee too many, without thinking too much).
Thank you in advance everyone.",t3_i5v1nt
1350,Miscarriage,"Our healthcare system is atrocious regardless but there is a special sting to it when I’m opening bill after bill for hundreds and hundreds of dollars for a baby that life didn’t even let me keep. 

I now owe $3,500.00 for going to the E.R. and all subsequent required visits to my O.B. That’s not including any of the costs of care prior to the MC. 

$3,500.00 gone. I would begrudgingly pay that for an ongoing pregnancy but it just feels especially cruel to owe so much money and the debt is just a reminder of the baby you don’t have.

1353,Miscarriage,"Hi girls,

So I had some spotting over the weekend very light pink only about 3 wipes and that was it. I went to follow up with my doctor on Monday he no longer saw a yolk sac and said I would miscarry. I was 6 weeks sac measured 5weeks. He was pushing a d&amp;c but because he didn't check my hsg levels all pregnancy (I was myself) when he drew my blood finally Monday he said my numbers were 20000. The previous Thursday they were 14000 so they did go up but not double within those 4 days. I told him my previous number and he said well it doubled so again my only option is a d&amp;c. My math 28000 would be doubling so the fact that it was less I feel it could already be going down and he had no interest in following up with another hcg bld test in 2 days to see if they decrease. I hung up on him I felt pushed into something I dont want to do. Now it's been 4 days since I found out I should miscarry and still nothing no blood not even a dot. How long should I wait to do this naturally before I start to worry? How long has it taken anyone else to start a miscarriage? Need some advice or others experiences through this!",t3_i5qo54
1354,Miscarriage,"I had a D&amp;C last Thursday. I only bled the day off, and day after very lightly.

1356,Miscarriage,"I was only six weeks and I genuinely don’t know how to feel. I had a scan when I was having pain and bleeding and was told that everything was fine, there was a heartbeat. Two days later after some more pain I was told it was a miscarriage. It was only my first time trying but I just feel really lost. I’m scared it will happen again. I just needed to vent.",t3_i5nwkb
1357,Miscarriage,"this was my first pregnancy. my first appointment was on monday and we thought i was about 10 weeks but when they did the ultrasound, all they saw was the sac and no baby. so they thought maybe i’m 5-6 weeks instead since it’s hard to tell how far along i am due to my irregular periods this year. so they ordered a blood test on monday and wednesday. my results on monday were 22,640 hcg which were levels for a pregnancy of 6weeks. i went to work wednesday after my other blood test. and about 10pm right before i got off, i went to the restroom and i was bleeding really bad. everyone kept saying “some women bleed their entire pregnancy.” “everything’s okay” “it’s normal sometimes.” but i just knew. but i tried to focus and stay positive but then i started cramping really bad at 1am and the thought that i miscarried wouldn’t leave my head. i finally dozed off for a few hours and woke up. alittle after 8am on thursday morning, i went to the bathroom and there was blood everywhere. my fiancé took me to the er and they did a ultrasound and the sac was gone. and my blood results from wednesday had went down since monday and are now at 18,768 and i was in fact having a miscarriage. 

it is by far the hardest thing i’ve been through. it was my biggest fear. i was so excited to be a mom and that excitement and my child was taken from me for reason i won’t know. 

i woke up today and it doesn’t seem real. well i don’t want it to be real. but it is and i’m so devastated. i don’t know what to do. and the pain is so bad. 

i’ve been trying to distract myself by watching melissa and joey and occasionally watching tiktok but every time i’m on there baby videos and pregnancy videos are all it shows. sometimes i just lay in bed in silence because i don’t know what to do. 

not to mention, i have to go back to work tomorrow.

I’m an emotional wreck about the entire situation, and I thought a d&amp;c would be best for me, as I don’t know if emotionally or physically ill be able to handle it at home. My OB does not offer the pill, so they either wait for you to miscarry naturally or do a d&amp;c. Today I went for my surgical talk and my doctor told me that because I’ve had 2 previous d&amp;c (abortions when I was very young and had no clue about reproductive health), that this 3rd d&amp;c could most likely make it harder for me to get pregnant, and that I’d be more susceptible to having problems with my future pregnancies. I left the office hysterical. I can’t change what I did 15 years ago. And now I don’t know whether to go through with this d&amp;c. I also know, some women who miscarry at home end up having to get a d&amp;c anyway. I’m so confused and scared and I can’t believe I’m going to have to make such a decision with the information I have now. I’m at a loss.
Has anyone been told this? Did it change things for you? Have you had a d&amp;c and miscarried naturally. Which would you do if you had to choose?

Then, August 1st, my boyfriend and i were having sex and noticed some blood. Went into Dr again, he checked my cervix and all was well. Then they take more blood from me, call me yesterday and tell me my levels have significantly dropped and that is a sign of a miscarriage.

1363,Miscarriage,"Hi ladies! Has anyone had a similar situation? :

I had a MC— the D&amp;C then sent tissue for testing which showed a large gene deletion on chromosome 1 as well as baby embryo was mosaic. My husband and I had karyotype testing done, both normal! I was told from genetic counselor that it’s “highly unlikely the baby’s deletion came from you guys due to normal karyotype and the fact that the baby was mosaic which is almost always formed after conception, not inherited” 

The limitation is that karyotype can’t detect as small of changes as the FISH test can. She said this can find balanced translocations that can then be passed on and cause issues. So she offered the FISH testing but again repeated that it’s highly unlikely this came from us. Did anyone ever have a similar situation? Did you decide to do the FISH test or not? I’m so torn! We have less than 10% chance that this came from us, but I’m also terrified if it did and it happens again but baby survives, poor babe would have severe issues. My gut tells me we don’t need the test bc she said her and the lab both agree it likely would be normal, but do I need 100% certainty? Ugh! If we do it, it’ll delay our IVF transfer about 6 weeks (more if it does come back with an issue but obviously then it would’ve been worth it to find; if nothing shows we’ll have peace of mind but would’ve wasted 6 more weeks which sounds like nothing but feels huge to me after over a year, losses, etc)",t3_i5bq4i

We recently went through a miscarriage. To say it was one of the hardest things we have ever done, would be putting it lightly. My wife has been a total warrior. She has been brave and strong through it all. 

I'm so sorry for anyone having to go through this. It's not easy. You all are amazing. 

I recommended to my wife she should share her story when she was ready. During the hardest days, she spent hours on YouTube hearing other's stories. Both to make sure she wasn't alone and to see if any of the experiences were like ours. 

She finally felt open enough to do so and has [posted a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIy5X8Dylio). I know it took a lot out of her.

When she was done with it, I could see the wounds opened up again. 

Every time we watched it to make sure it made sense, we cried. As horrible as it was, it somehow provided more healing for us. Would love if you had some free time to check it out. She doesn't like Reddit as much as I do, so I couldn't get her to write it out for me.

it's really frustrating to me because i went to the hospital two times the week before i lost that baby with concerns because i wouldn't stop bleeding, feeling in my gut that something was wrong but they brushed me off both times because the baby still had a healthy heartbeat. i was having continuous light bleeding and pink/tan discharge during the week before one day a lot of clear liquid rushed out of me and i was really confused at what it was but stupidly didn't think anything of it. 

then a few hours later i just felt something drop out of me into my underwear, no pain, just a slight pushing feeling. i was horrified and honestly too afraid to look to see what it was because in my heart i already knew. i rushed to the hospital and they confirmed that yes, i had lost my baby at sixteen weeks and it was a boy which was what i was hoping for. 😞 i was absolutely devastated. 

my obgyn told me that sounded like a short cervix loss. is it wrong of me to feel like they failed me and my baby? it really hurts me to think that the baby was alive and healthy before i lost him and it was something that could've easily been fixed. he would've been born this month 💔

ive heard a lot of other stories where doctors find out a woman has short cervix after an exam and they put in an emergency cerclage. they only gave me an ultrasound and sent me out when the baby had a healthy heartbeat even after i insisted i felt like something was wrong. my moms convinced its something to due with my age, i was eighteen when that happened but i don't know if thats true or not.

I usually would go to my mom but I don’t want her to worry about me or to be sad so I need someone to reassure me that my experience is normal I guess. My cycle is usually 28 days on the dot I bleed lightly on the first heavy on days 2 and 3 and lightly days 4-7. I was a week late and assumed I was pregnant but wasn’t in a rush to test. I tested Saturday around 2 and got a faint but definitely positive result so we decided I would test again in the morning and we would go from there. 20 mins later I was bleeding HEAVILY and cramping badly. That lasted thru Sunday. I use a period cup usually and noticed that I was passing tissue maybe the length of my fingers and on monday the blood started to smell foul. I completely stopped bleeding on Tuesday and have been in a lot of pain and kinda dazed and out of it mentally since then. Today(thursday) around 5pm I started bleeding again and cramping. Something seems off and I’m not sure if I should be worried or just push thru it. I guess I just need some support and reassurance.",t3_i53hfl

Found out on August 1st that I'm pregnant but it was still quite early. We weren't expecting this news as we thought we wouldn't be able to get pregnant without treatments. We were so surprised but over the moon.

On the 4th I started having minor cramps and spotting to which I was told to monitor it over the next day. Yesterday I thought everything was fine until the bleeding and cramping became worse than it had been the night before.

 I was instructed to go to the ER last night. On the 1st my levels we're 10 and yesterday the 5th 13. The doctor said she believes I will miscarry due to my levels not rising and they should be higher however she said there is still a chance it could go up over the next few weeks

Due to Covid no one is allowed to be at the hospital with me and my seven year old who is usually attached to my hip is obviously confused as to why mum is in hospital and why he can't see me which makes it harder.

Yesterday I was a complete mess but woke up today trying to be positive and keep an open mind. The bleeding and cramps weren't so bad this morning but again seem to be getting worse. 
It's so hard not to know what to expect or not know what will happen. 
I'm trying to be strong but I just feel scared and confused. I don't want to talk to anyone around me about it because I feel like I have to be strong for them.

I just had my first pregnancy that ended with a silent/missed miscarriage at the 12 week mark. 

I think I’m holding up okay, but I’m looking for some words of support and wisdom during these times. 

I’m in the my early thirties, healthy weight, non-smoker, no underlying serious health conditions. Husband and I had been trying for 4 months and I finally found out I was pregnant in May. I soon went for my first ultrasound and saw the embryo with a heart beat. It was estimated the pregnancy was just a few days short of 7 weeks. So exited about it and shared with my immediately family. 

About 3 weeks ago, I started seeing light brown spotting on a daily basis. Contacted the doc and did research and found this was normal. 

I went in for my 12 week ultra sound this precious Friday. I would have been 12 weeks 5 days. 

No baby was seen on the ultra sound, just an empty gestational sac that measured about 10 weeks. The baby was gone, absorbed back into my body per the doctor. I had a silent miscarriage. 

I understand I couldn’t have prevented this, but I’m beating myself up for not going in when I started the spotting.  If I had gone in 2 or 3 weeks ago 

They scheduled an MVA in the office for five days later, Wednesday (today). I understand it’s slightly less invasive than a D&amp;C. 

I felt so shocked, I always thought miscarriages were something like seeing a bunch of blood, realizing it was a miscarriage, grieving for a few days and moving forward with your life. 

It was like a gut punch of surprise and guilt. I had to milk ice over the issue for five days until Wednesday knowing I was still carrying the remnants of my dissolved baby inside of me. 

Today, they requested I stick 4 pills of misoprostol in my vagina four hours before the procedure. I felt completely fine until about 3 hours 15 minutes afterwards.

I then started experiencing the worst cramping feeling my life, feeling like I was getting continuously punched in the lower abdomen. I’ve been blessed my whole life with virtually non existent cramps during my period in the past, so this was a new feeling for me. 

I was writhing in pain when I checked in and they quickly ushered me into the room and administered a shot of some medicine, can’t remember, but it started with a T. I felt very slight cramping relief within the next few minutes. 

I was able to see the ultrasound on the screen while the procedure was being performed. The ultrasound tech was super nice and was answering all my questions about what I was seeing on the screen. 

The doctor stuck the speculum in and injected lidocaine. While the injection was happening the pain was excruciating and the nurse there was holding my hand tightly while I cried. About 30 seconds later I felt much more relief. 

The empty gestation sac was emptied into a bottle. 

I requested to see it and it was just a little bottle of blood with some black bits (I’m assuming tissue) in it. 

We opted not to send it off for chromosome testing due to the fact that this was my first miscarriage.  
 
After all was said and done I felt 99.9% better. 

Doctor is going to meet with me 2 weeks later to discuss post op and run some genetic testing. 

Husband and I are planning to try to conceive after I get my next period.",t3_i4bnps
1379,Miscarriage,"Hi all,

I posted on here a little over a month ago after we tragically went for our 20 week scan only to find out our baby had passed away at 15 weeks. It’s been very tough and we were getting back to normal, but today has definitely brought it all back.

We got the results back from the post-mortem and they showed that at around 14 weeks the placenta had slightly detached causing some spotting that we saw one morning. After that there had been a large clot which began to form within the placenta effectively cutting off nutrients to the baby.

I guess we are glad we found out what happened, but at the same time we are left worrying it’s going to happen again. I think we were hoping for some sort of preventive measure we could take the next time but it doesn’t look like it’s going to happen.

I’m just reaching out because I’m not familiar at all with this outcome and what it could mean for the future and us trying again? Has anyone else had a similar experience?",t3_i435e7
1380,Miscarriage,I have stage 4 endometriosis and have been TTC for 5 years. We have had 2 unsuccessful OE IVF cycles and recently tried a donor egg cycle which was successful but unfortunately ended in a miscarriage at 9 weeks. We did fetus testing which indicated that the baby was a chromosomally normal baby girl. I was devestated to learn my body had failed me once again. 😔 Now my clinic wants me to do a Lupus Anticoagulant Profile and the Reactiva test. Has anyone had experience with these or with miscarriage of a chromosomally normal baby? Anything else you think we should look in to or advice? Thank you!,t3_i4dyu9
1381,Miscarriage,"I had an ultrasound yesterday which would have been 7 weeks, 5 days and they said that the embryo measured 6 weeks and some change and had a heart rate of only 69 bpm. Very likely that this will end in miscarriage. I was told to wait a week and get another ultrasound then to see if there have been any changes. I guess they need to wait until there is no heartbeat to induce a miscarriage or do a D&amp;C. 

This is terrible. I know that this baby is not going to survive and I feel like it's torture just knowing it's still inside of me and there is nothing I can do. Both  me and my husband's family are very anti-abortion, so even if there was an ultrasound that showed no heartbeat, they would want me to wait for it to pass naturally. 

I feel like I have no control over this and I'm just helpless. I just want this to be over. I still feel pregnant so I am constantly being reminded that there is a dying baby inside of me. I know there is nothing to do except wait, but honestly, i just wish there wasn't a heartbeat at all and we could just get this over with.

UPDATE: No heartbeat was found today, opted for the sedated D&amp;C. Just got home from everything and feeling relieved and just ready to start fresh. Went ahead and sent the tissue for genetic testing just for our information. ❤️ 2020 can suck it.",t3_i47jvg
1382,Miscarriage,"I just got confirmation that our first pregnancy is a CP. We'd had some indication, and I spent most of yesterday crying, knowing what was likely coming. I knew it was a possibility and thought I'd be happy to have a definitive answer whilst also knowing it was possible to get pregnant, but this is so much worse than I expected. I feel like I'm far too sad for ""just"" a CP, when other people have it so much worse - multiple or much later losses.

But we knew we were pregnant long enough to get attached, to care, to envision our future. And we were pregnant long enough to feel like we were saved from the ttc journey, which I find extremely emotionally difficult. Two of our really close couple friends got pregnant this cycle or last, and I thought we'd all get to be pregnant together and have our kids at the same time - we all live in the same place so they'd have even been in the same schools. I feel like the sounds ridiculous, because we only knew for a few days... but it's so hard not to dream about the possible future. Now I'm scared to see my friends and watch them progress, and I think their babies will likely always make me think of the one I lost and what might have been.

My husband is being supportive, but he also doesn't feel it like I do. He spent yesterday convinced everything was fine - I called him at work today to let him know and he cried on the phone and it was just so heartbreaking. I know there's nothing we could have done but he will be such a good father and I want to make him one so badly.

I'm sorry this must all sound so dramatic and jumbled. I'm kind of in shock and I can't work out how sad I should be - it is so early, we knew it was a possibility, but I'm still finding it completely devastating.",t3_i4498d
1383,Miscarriage,"It actually made me feel better, giving my grief a name. I suffered a loss in February but couldn’t shake the grief, deep sadness, anger, frustration, and jealousy of others. I’d cry. A lot. I didn’t understand why I felt so messed up considering we didn’t even make it to 8 weeks. Like I didn’t deserve these emotions. My husband (who’s been 1000% supportive) encouraged me to talk to a doctor and the doctor diagnosed me with postpartum depression. In a way, it made me feel a little more normal again, and less “crazy” for being so sad for so long. 

I encourage everyone who suffers a loss to seek help, in whatever form you’re comfortable with. 

I meet with my doctor every week on Zoom, and I get to say the things out loud that I was too embarrassed or scared to say to anyone else. It’s freeing and it makes me feel so heard and understood. I can say I finally feel like I’m healing.",t3_i43lx9
1384,Miscarriage,"With the upcoming date of our daughter being born 6 years ago at 21 weeks and unfortunately only being with us here on Earth for 15 minutes approximately, I wanted to reach out and do something for others.   May people came to my wife and I during our time of loss and it was quite comforting looking back.  She had full support from family, friends, professionals, etc.  However, I was somewhat left outside looking in.   It was traumatic and hit me hard and it took me a long time to really talk about it.   

But as the years have passed I’ve slowly gotten better.  Problem was, in the beginning, she was looked after mentally and physically as expected, but I wasn’t really mentally there for her as I don’t think I did all I could to help her as I was suffering but keeping it bottled up ( bad move).

If there is a guy that needs my opinion on some course of action to help cope or maybe a grieving mom who needs a guys point of view that went through this, please feel free to reach out anytime and I’d be more than willing to discuss.  

Thanks for reading, be well, be strong and much love to you all.",t3_i4017u
1385,Miscarriage,"On August 10th, it will be my baby’s 1st angelversary &amp; I don’t know how I’ll make it through. Even though me &amp; my wife lost them a year ago, the wound is still fresh &amp; it hurts every day knowing that they aren’t here with us. They would’ve been 5 months on the 17th &amp; sometimes it’s too much to handle. We were thinking of doing something for them since it’s kind of their “birthday” like maybe buy a bunch of balloons &amp; let them go but we don’t know yet because we don’t know how we’ll feel the day of. How did you guys handle your first angelversary? 

I wish everyone on here strength &amp; just know that you’re not alone.
Be safe everyone &amp; please take care.

1386,Miscarriage,"The past few days have been difficult.

My SIL just had her gender reveal over the weekend, which I had to help set up (even though I didn’t want to because I’m still sad about my miscarriages).

Meanwhile, I’ve still been struggling with my most recent miscarriage.

Today a family member shouted at the top of his lungs: “*I prayed your baby would die, and it did! And if you’re pregnant now, I hope it dies too*!”

That comment literally knocked the breath out of me. I’m in shock. I feel numb.

All of this because I said that I didn’t like being called offensive inappropriate names (aka racial slurs) by 3 people in this family member’s life and will choose to not be around them anymore because they won’t stop. Apparently, me making boundaries and telling him in a calm manner (as opposed to yelling at these 3 people or doing anything aggressive) was too much or unreasonable in his eyes.

Secretly, my husband and I finally started trying again last month (after holding off for months due to my depression caused by my last miscarriage), and I’ve been taking hcg test strips daily for tracking (in hopes that I am currently pregnant).

This person knows my journey and struggle. The depression that followed. Me getting out of that depression (finally) very recently. I was doing really good for awhile. Now I feel completely worthless.

Can anyone please say a prayer for me? I would appreciate it. Tears are now flowing uncontrollably as I write this. No one would understand better than people here, people who have been through loss. Thank you for reading.",t3_i3u5t7
1387,Miscarriage,"Last week I made a post about having a miscarriage (empty gestational sac) and man did things get worse. 

I had light spotting and little to no cramping all week after my miscarriage until last night around 6 I started to have some cramping. At first it was period like cramping then out of no where I was laying on the shower floor because the cramps were so intense. I suddenly realize a large flow of blood going down the drain when I hopped out of the shower and sat on the toilet to see if it was real or just being watered down. From 9:30-midnight I ended up bleeding through 6 mega pads and had 20+ lemon to baseball size clots. I rushed to the hospital during this as I knew something bad was happening. I remember walking into the er doors and blood dripping down my legs on to the floor. After being checked out, I ended up having a piece of tissue stuck in my cervix opening and was causing me to bleed heavily. I was taken care of and sent home. 

When I first got home I had light bleeding and a few blood clots. It quickly turned into me passing large clots every few minutes. At first I thought it was my body cleaning out but about an hour later I went to stand up to go to the bathroom and passed out from being so dizzy. My fiancé and I quickly got back in the car and rushed back to the ER, a mere 3 hours after we left. I threw up the whole way as my body was fighting me so much. 

After 7 hours, we found out that I have tissue in my uterus still. I don’t know why an ultrasound wasn’t done the first time I was in as it would of been seen. I ended up losing a third of my blood volume in a 5 hour span. I’m now admitted to the ob floor for observation while I take meds to try and clear it out. If it doesn’t work, then an emergency d&amp;c. I thought the passing of my gestational sac was going to be the most traumatizing part of my miscarriage but I was wrong. I remember thinking at one point I was literally going to bleed out in the middle of the ER. 

Morally of the story, get frequent check ups when you have a miscarriage! I know my situation is extreme, but I put my blood work and stuff off because I was wanting to put everything behind me. Now as I lay in the hospital bed, I wonder what I could have done to prevent this.",t3_i3plrr
1388,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone - I need to be surrounded by people right now who understand what I’m going through. I didn’t think I’d be here today. 

I opted to get a private ultrasound this afternoon as I had been feeling like something was off due to a lack of symptoms around week 8 and wanted to feel like it was all just in my head. I had light brownish spotting at 5-6 weeks and went in for an early US where a heartbeat was detected. We went in at week 7 to follow up that it had increased (it did!) but I guess in week 8, the baby decided to stop growing. While it wasn’t a medical ultrasound, it was pretty obvious to me that I had a MMC and the tech said it wasn’t where it should be by 9w4d + no cardiac activity. I’ve yet to have any bleeding or cramping.

I’m heartbroken, we were just talking about names last night and I bought something special to me and my husband that we were going to use for our announcement in a few weeks. I also have PCOS and don’t know if that has any correlation to me miscarrying. It was such a shock to get pregnant pretty much immediately after we stopped using condoms that I thought this was meant to be, the stars aligning. I can’t help but feel something is wrong with me even though my rational side says that’s not the case. Fingers crossed for a 🌈 as soon as we can.",t3_i3wvm0
1389,Miscarriage,"I am pretty certain I miscarried early last week (doctors predicted it), and I’ve been in a 10 day limbo waiting for my ultrasound to confirm. I tried to get in sooner, but naturally, they have been booked and can’t squeeze me in (that’s for another vent later).

I’ve confided in one of my friends about this struggle for two reasons: 1) she is normally really supportive and I needed to vent, and 2) she is currently pregnant with her second and she knows the struggle of getting pregnant. 

In hind sight, I wish I didn’t confide in her and instead confided in someone else who experienced this overwhelming sadness and anger. 

Now, I know she probably doesn’t know what to say and that she means well, but when she said “I get it. It’s something you wanted so bad” after I said I never understood how terrible and emotional a miscarriage is until I had one, I felt a rage come over me. 

No, you don’t get it. It’s not just something I wanted so bad. 

It’s my body betraying me. 

It’s a sense of guilt I carry with me. Did I do something that caused this?

It’s the anger I feel every time I think of all the awful people in the world who can reproduce. Yet, I can’t. 

It’s the constant reminder when I change my pad. 

It’s the future plans that we made that are now canceled. 

It’s the overwhelming sadness every time you talk about your toddler and pregnancy.

Again, I know that she means well, but I am really frustrated that someone who has been blessed with zero miscarriages or scares and two healthy pregnancies can say that she “gets it” while I help plan her baby shower. 

*note: I’m just really mad at the world about this, and I could just be taking it out on her. I’m just so sad.",t3_i3wuxa
1390,Miscarriage,"A friend from a long time, since school days. Recently told me they had a miscarriage. I think i handled everything poorly as I have not known anyone to have one before. They moved through the conversation briefly and changed subject quickly. I feel like so terrible barely providing comfort since I was so so shocked and did not know what to say besides being so sorry for them. Later in the day we were talking and I had a terrible day at work and cried to them. Just could not help myself and I felt even worse for being upset for something so miniscule after they told me something that was probably so hard for them. I feel like a terrible person. Any input on how I can provide comfort and show her how much I care? Any thoughts or responses on how I can undo my responses that I had earlier? Can't stop thinking about it and wish I had played things out differently. Thank you.",t3_i41eg4
1391,Miscarriage,"I wish there were a different term for it.

Mistake. Mismanage. Misbehave.

All imply that a party involved made a bad decision, resulting in something undesirable. I surely didn’t desire this, but the etymology of the word implies much more than an unwanted outcome.

Somehow from the beginning I knew that this wasn’t it. It felt too easy, so quick and effortless. 
It was Tuesday. I tried to make him pee on one too just to make sure a second line didn’t show up on every test every time. Instead, I used another myself and got a second confirmation.

On Wednesday in the office, the nurse congratulated me, but part of me resented her for it; the same part of me that doubted all along. When she poked her head inside after taking my sample to the lab and asked: “when did you say you got the positive test?” I wasn’t surprised. It had been too easy. The concern on her face matched how I’d felt from the start. Negative via urine, so blood was drawn.

Thursday morning, I got an email. 30 mIU/ml count by blood. Barely a level considered pregnant, but definitely not not pregnant. More blood work was scheduled for Monday. 

So on Thursday, I started to hope. I had super smell and an exploding bosom. I could feel something happening in my body. Maybe it truly had been that easy. If my doubts were unfounded, it wouldn’t be the first time my brain had invented awful realities that weren’t true. Maybe this was it. 

Friday morning, I woke and knew right away that I’d lost it. I felt normal again. Whatever had started happening in my body had stopped. It was gone.

Saturday morning, the bleeding confirmed what I already knew.

Mishap. Misuse. Mistrust. 

All imply that somebody acted badly. 

They say it’s not my fault, and I believe them. But I wonder how they can assure me it’s not, and then still insist on using that word.",t3_i3rvdg
1392,Miscarriage,"I see all sorts of experiences on here, and I found reading about the absolute worst and the best case scenario (if that's even a thing?) made me feel better and less afraid for my own miscarriage. So I'd like to share what my miscarriage was like, both as a way to help provide insight for others and to help give me closure. 

Back in at the end of June, when I was 6 weeks pregnant, I was cooking and felt a sudden gush in my underwear, not too unlike when your period starts. I ran to the bathroom and there was bright red blood in my underwear. It wasn't a continuous flow, but it took several wipes to get it cleaned off. I immediately called the midwife, who with all the grace and kindness in the world, told me it could be nothing or it could be the start of a miscarriage. She asked me to come in for an HCG check the next day. I should add that this was the only blood that I passed leading up to passing the miscarriage itself. The only thing that tipped her off was the color of the blood. It wasn't dark or light pink, it was a bright red. 

I went for my HCG check and the results were ...not great, but not bad. Instead of doubling as fast as they should, they were rising but at a very slow rate. But it wasn't quite slow enough to be an obvious miscarriage. I don't remember the exact levels, but it had a doubling rate of 7 days. I was ordered to have an ultrasound, but due to lack of availability and understaffing I had to wait an entire week. No that's not long, but waiting to hear if your pregnancy is viable makes it feel like an eternity. 

I had my ultrasound when I was 8 weeks pregnant and I knew immediately something was wrong. It was too small, and the tech was struggling to find a heartbeat. I was asked to undress from the waist down for a vaginal ultrasound, during which there was clearly no heartbeat. The poor tech was trying so hard to be positive but I knew the fetus had stopped developing. I was moved to my midwife's office where she did confirm the fetus had stopped developing at 6 weeks and there was no heartbeat, which combined with my HCG levels confirmed I had a missed miscarriage. The decision to have a ""natural"" miscarriage at home, a medicated miscarriage with Misoprostal, or having a D&amp;C was up to me. At that point I had spent two weeks waiting in limbo to find out what the fuck was going on and I was done. I wanted to move on and try to regain some control in this mess so I opted for Misoprostal. It was 8 tablets, 4 under the tongue in the morning and 4 again at night. 

All the stories I'd read online about Miso terrified me. I'd read about people having horrific cramps, out of control bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea. Well, that doesn't happen to anyone. The Miso did absolutely nothing for me. No cramping, no nausea, no bleeding. Nothing. I did have an allergic reaction to the Miso (my tongue and throat swelled a bit and my hands turned bright red and itchy, so that's a thing) but some Benadryl took care of it. It was a relief to not experience what I'd read online, but I actually found it incredibly frustrating and disheartening to have literally nothing happen. I'd spent several days leading up to it crying, panicking, agonizing over what it was going to be like, and then coming to terms with it and taking the medicine for it to not even remotely remove anything was so frustrating. I was told to give it a few days to see if it would work, and if not then I could come in for a D&amp;C. I ended up needing the D&amp;C. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's also a lot of testimonies out there about D&amp;C's, ranging from good to scary. I'm lucky to say my D&amp;C was as good as I could've hoped for. I checked in, was brought back into the OR, and then woke up a bit later. The whole procedure was 20 minutes, the nurses, anesthesiologist, and OB were all very compassionate and sweet. However, I did wake up blubbering and sobbing which was honestly pretty mortifying. I remember begging to see the fetus, asking to hold the nurse's hand, and asking repeatedly if I wasn't pregnant anymore. But again, the nurse was SO kind. I was sent home with some painkillers and told to watch for excessive bleeding, a fever, etc. Shockingly, I didn't cramp at all after that. I bled lightly for about 6 days, it never got worse than a light period. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that was it. My follow up appointment is tomorrow, but I stopped bleeding two weeks ago and nothing is out of the ordinary. No fever, no cramping. I still haven't gotten my period back yet and I've heard the first one post miscarriage can be rough. But for something so shitty, unexpected, and heartbreaking, my experience really went as smoothly as I could've asked for. I'm terrified to try and get pregnant again, and I cried a little when the MA at my primary care doc asked about my ""irregular periods"" since my last menstrual cycle was in May and I had to explain I had a miscarriage. But really, it wasn't painful and scary. I hope detailing my experience with Miso and the D&amp;C is insightful for some of you.",t3_i3rdim
1393,Miscarriage,"Never thought I’d be posting here but here it goes. My ex and I have still been having unprotected sex together since we broke up but I stopped keeping track of my period because I wasn’t having sex regularly like we used to. Give or take, we’d have sex maybe two to three times a month as of lately. My period has always been regular for years with all the telltale signs; cramps, sore breasts, back pain, etc. prior to so I can always anticipate when it’s coming.

I haven’t paid close attention to my period lately and haven’t been too concerned about it coming on time because I figured I barely have sex these days anyway so there’s no way I could be pregnant. 

On Sunday, I woke up with excruciating cramps and pain in my abdomen so I chalked it up to my period coming. I thought it was weird that I didn’t feel it coming before this. The pain was so bad though that I couldn’t even eat. I also wasn’t wearing proper underwear at the time so I used the last tampon I had. It soaked through fairly quickly but because I was out and about, I couldn’t do much about it and couldn’t tell how much I was bleeding, plus I was wearing black. I also noticed that the blood smelled much worse this time around. When I was finally able to shower and clean down there, I noticed a lot of blood clots on my loofa. One clot that also had a clear like membrane to it and the more I cleaned, flesh like parts had come out of my vagina. Enough that I was able to pick it up between my fingers. 

I didn’t even think in that moment that maybe I had been pregnant, possibly now 6 weeks? Like I said, I wasn’t keeping track of my period cycle anymore. But now I’m convinced that this might’ve been an early miscarriage. I’ve never passed tissue in any of my periods and have never seen anything like that come out of me before. It’s been two days and I’m still bleeding but not as heavily but I’m still having back pain and slight nausea. 

I don’t believe I had any pregnancy symptoms before this. The stress of this breakup has really thrown me off so it’s hard for me to even tell. Maybe more frequent urination? I’ve been depressed for months so my mood and my weight have been fluctuating. But I don’t remember when my last period was exactly. It could’ve been more than a month ago.

Is it even worth it to take a pregnancy test or go to the doctor if I believe everything has pretty much passed naturally? If I take a pregnancy test and it tests negative, does that mean that maybe this wasn’t a miscarriage even though all the signs point to it?

Please help :(",t3_i3wb8j
1394,Miscarriage,"I had a D&amp;C last Wednesday, 7/29 (6 days ago) after finding there was no heartbeat on my fetus with a CRL of 8.2 weeks (should have been 9 weeks or so by gestational age).  When I went in for the D&amp;C, I experienced zero spotting or bleeding in the week between the ultrasound and the procedure.  

In the past week following the D&amp;C, I have been surprised at the lack of bleeding.  I had some minimal bleeding immediately after the procedure, but then only spotting in the day or two after and very little since.  

Today, my OB calls to see how I'm doing and to ""check on my timeline.""  Apparently, the pathologist didn't find any actual fetal tissue in the D&amp;C content.  OB says he removed ""a LOT"" of tissue from me, so is surprised they didn't find the actual fetus, but wanted to check in to see whether I had been bleeding before the D&amp;C.  I assume this question implies that I could have passed the fetus before the D&amp;C itself.  As I mentioned, I had zero bleeding before the procedure and very little after, so i'm fairly certain that I did not pass it before or after.

Anyhow, OB then advises that since I've had so little bleeding, it's probably just a mistake on the pathologist's part, so he's having a second pathologist review.  However, ""just to be safe,"" he wants me to go in for an ultrasound to make sure everything has been removed.  I'm so upset by this -- I feel like I was finally coming to terms with my loss and hearing that there's a possibility that the fetus could still be inside me feels like a scab being ripped off a freshly-healing wound.  

I guess I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, and what was the result?  I go for my follow up u/s tomorrow afternoon.  I do want to mention that I also have a bicornuate uterus, which the OB was aware of before the D&amp;C.  I'm guessing that this could mean I'm at higher risk of something like this happening, but at the same time, why don't they just do an ultrasound during/immediately following the procedure if there's risk of something like this?!",t3_i3pxsp
1395,Miscarriage,"When I found out I was pregnant I couldn’t have been more surprised. 
Both my husband and I were told that we were unlikely to have children due to our own individual health concerns before we even knew each other, so I was very surprised and excited and immediately told everyone, and I mean everyone!
I posted to social media and told my family, my husband was calling his family the second the test said positive.
I know it’s recommended that you not tell people until after the first trimester in case of complications, but we couldn’t contain our excitement.
In my 6th week I miscarried, and I told everyone pretty quickly, but there have still been a few people even a month later that didn’t know and ask how my pregnancy is going.
Now I’m not upset for the reason you might think (that they are bringing up a painful topic) that doesn’t bother me and I’m ok to talk about it.

What absolutely boils my blood is the people that say “I’m sorry, you know it’s really common” or “I know someone who (or I personally) miscarried x amount of times but then they had x amount of kids” yes I am aware it is common especially in first pregnancies and I knew that going in, that doesn’t make it hurt any less. And I’m not worried at this point that my next pregnancy will be a miscarriage. Or “maybe next time don’t tell people so soon because sharing bad new sucks, wait till you’re further along” that is a direct quote from someone btw.

Excuse the f out of me?! I’ll tell people whenever I want, I know the possible outcome, but if I am bursting with excitement and I wanna share my joy on the 6 o’clock news right after peeing on a stick then I will! And “it sucks to share bad news” ?! No sh Sherlock! You know what really sucks? Having my experience explained to me constantly, and being compared to others, feeling that my joy or my grief is being belittled, that’s what sucks!

What it feels like they are saying is “next time you get pregnant contain your joy until it’s less likely that you’ll miscarry because hearing about your traumatic experience is depressing and it’s awkward having to comfort you” 😤 🤷🏻‍♀️

1396,Miscarriage,"New here, apologies if I don't use the proper flair or terms, not meaning to offend anyone. After a positive test, went to the Dr for 1st checkup. Was told I should be around 9 weeks ( even though my app says 6 weeks). Dr kept apologizing saying it doesn't look good, and the gestional sac is collapsing. I was in shock and barely registered what he was telling me. I have to come back in 2 weeks for a repeat scan to confirm no growth. Has anyone dealt with this before? What should I expect? I'm very angry.",t3_i3kc53
1397,Miscarriage,"My first OB appt was yesterday. I was 9 weeks but only measuring around 7. It was pretty clear that there wasn’t anything in the sac. My hcg levels were 4700. The nurse told me not to even bother coming in for the repeat labs. They will do another ultrasound in 2 weeks just to be 100% sure. (I’m already positive on the dates so this is just a formality for me). They will hopefully be able to schedule a D&amp;C that same week. 

Here’s my question. If my body starts to miscarry at home before my scheduled procedure wtf is that going to feel like? I’ve read stories of women taking the miso pill to induce the miscarriage and then it’s a horrible experience. I really don’t want to see or go through that at my house. 😭",t3_i3sbka
1398,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone, I’m using a throwaway because I just don’t want to be judged. I want to let out my feelings here. Even if I get no responses. I want to start off by saying I’m so very sorry for each and every one of you. I wouldn’t wish this physical/emotional pain on my worst enemy. 
I am 32 and got pregnant unplanned. It was a surprise but a nice one. I have always wanted to be a mom. I stressed a lot when I found out, I’m a smoker, I take medication for anxiety. There was a lot I needed to change in a short amount of time. It made me anxious instead of excited. I thought to myself, maybe this isn’t the right time. I want to be completely healthy before conceiving, but life doesn’t always work that way . I was never able to feel emotionally attached, I had to figure out quitting everything. And even withdrawals from medication. I knew it had to be done, but it did take away from enjoying the first few weeks. At about 6 weeks I had a huge bleed, clots, went to ER. Fetus was still in the sac. Followed up with gyno, was diagnosed with a SCH. Was on bed rest for a week, then came yesterday. I went to my US, and the doctor came in and said I had a missed miscarriage. The bleeding scared me, I had prepared myself for the worst. But then I looked at all the positive stories and had hope. All of my emotions rushed in at the same time, I was devastated. I couldn’t help but think, the 2 abortions I had at 18. And 20 were some kind of bad karma that was now catching up with me. I was in An abusive relationship back then, and it just wasn’t going to be a good outcome especially for a child. But I still beat myself up for it, especially now. 
I thought if I had never been a smoker, this wouldn’t have happened, if I wasn’t going through withdrawals, this wouldn’t have happened. I have put all the blame on myself. And honestly don’t think I’m able to even think about pregnancy again. I feel it would be full of anxiety, waiting for something like this to happen again. 
I scheduled a d&amp;c, I can’t possibly go through this at home, my mental health can’t take it. I do applaud women brave enough to do so. My d&amp;c isn’t for two weeks, next Friday. Now I sit with the feeling that I have my unborn, passed away child inside of me- for two weeks. And it makes me absolutely sick to my stomach and is not helping my already fragile emotional state. Just last week I was googling my due date March 22nd. I was starting to get excited. 
I always knew women went through this, and I always felt so horrible for them. But I never thought it would happen to me, and now it has. And I’m just another statistic. I don’t pity myself, I blame myself. 
I was a lot more attached then I thought. I’m just sad. And scared. 
Thanks for reading.",t3_i3it42
1399,Miscarriage,"I started spotting last Tuesday for a few days and on Friday I had a miscarriage. I have absolutely no doubt that I miscarried after what came out of me but my doctor appointment isn't until tomorrow to confirm with him. I know he'll answer all of my questions but I've noticed from this page and other pages about pregnancy that doctors opinions can vary greatly and I thought it would he helpful to hear the advice/stories of other woman who have actually gone through this and luckily none of my friends have had a miscarriage before. 

 Question 1: How long did you bleed after your miscarriage? I'm down to a slow spot right now and occasional cramps and this is day 5 post MC.
2: How long did you wait to have sex again after your MC? My bf and I are very intimate together and I already miss those interactions.
3: How long did it take for your period to come back?
4: How long were you told to wait to start trying again? My partner and I want to have a child so unbelievably bad and I want to start trying again as soon as I can. 

Thanks in advance for answering. I'm really dreading my appointment tomorrow and am worried that I'll need medical assistance to complete the miscarriage, I get anxiety when I have to go to the doctors for anything let alone something like this.",t3_i3m2xl

1401,Miscarriage,"Following bad bleeding on the weekend and a blood test showing my HCG wasn't rising I had to go for an ultrasound today to check where things were at as my doctor had said the pregnancy probably wasn't viable but you never know. The woman doing my ultrasound had clearly not read my notes at all as she quickly scanned me and said ""Nope, you're completely normal nothing to worry about here as I can't see any sign of you being pregnant whatsoever. You look very normal"". Ouch. She obviously didn't mean to be rude and got the wrong end of why I was there but fucking hell did that hurt. This experience sucks so bad",t3_i3g1fr
1402,Miscarriage,"I am no stranger to grief. I've held it my heart since the day I realized fairy tales are not something one can wish for. There is never an easy ending. There will never be a happily ever after. There will never be closure. Life changes abruptly and that change always lacks warning.

But THIS hurts worst than anything I have ever felt. 

I have friends that I will never have a chance to see again in this life. I've played with children that will never grow old. I've held the paws of my best friend as she seized up and the light left her eyes. 

And in this moment, I don't feel a comparison for the pain in my heart.

I thought that if I was already broken into a million tiny pieces, that I couldn't be shattered anymore. Now I see that was nothing more than a challenge. That every time I glue myself back together, it's nothing more than opportunity to knock me off the highest shelf and start the process all over again. 

I'm done repairing. I'd rather end up on a random shoe and hope that it takes the dust of me as far away from this life as possible.

 They say that ""God helps those that help themselves"" and that used to bring me comfort. From now on, I'm calling bullshit. 

I have pushed and pulled and tugged at this life with all of my might, and it seems to have gotten me almost no where. I feel like I am being sucked under by a force greater than anything I could ever muster the will to fight. 

I'm forever stuck in the doldrums or being pulled down by the undertow. 

I am no longer under the illusion that I am a mermaid.

 I can not breathe underwater. 

Now, I feel that the only thing that I can do is accept that fate and hope that looking up from the bottom of the ocean is as beautiful as I always thought that it would be. That maybe there is more comfort in just accepting your luck, than there is fighting with that last ounce of energy just to feel the fear when your lungs finally fill with the destiny you've been fighting to escape.

And the worst part is...

I can't tell a soul.

Because what if they say,  ""This pain? This hurt?""
 
""It's for the best"".",t3_i3bhjm
1403,Miscarriage,"I'm so tired of fighting with my insurance company to refund the money I paid out for the miscarriage. and D&amp;C.  It's been since April. I will be doing so well and finding that bright spot. Then. Nope. Crashing down as I chase my refund.

I'm honestly exhausted and frustrated. In part because right now I need that money for living costs. But mostly because I have to be reminded every time I start to emotionally heal that I still can't move on. Months of this. It feels abusive at this point, the pattern.

We want to start trying for kids again, but all these things do is remind me that having a baby is for other people. Just upping my depression again once I've finally gotten it under control. All I wanted was to move on. To be happy. To try again and be hopeful. (Oh, that's a hard word since I named the baby Hope. Haaa on me.)",t3_i3i2q1
1404,Miscarriage,"We had our first (private) ultrasound yesterday, I was supposed to be 8+4 weeks, however we were told the baby hadn’t grown past 6 weeks and there was no heartbeat. 
What made the experience worse was that after the ultrasound, they made us sit right next to the scan room whilst they printed out our documents so we heard the next couples perfectly fine scan and all the excitement coming from the room. My heart broke even more, why couldn’t that be me? 

I just feel so heartbroken, I don’t know what to do with myself. I can’t bring myself to leave my bed today and can’t stop crying. 

I have a hospital appointment tomorrow, but I already know what they’re going to tell me and what decisions I’m going to have to make, I just wish this wasn’t real. 

Myself and my partners families were so excited about this, and I feel like I’ve let everybody down. I also feel so angry. From the second I found out I was pregnant I’ve made sure I did everything right. No caffeine, all the right vitamins and foods. Why has this still happened?

1406,Miscarriage,Prior to my first miscarriage I had 3 different dreams in which I woke up in bed covered in blood. They were so vivid that I even took repeat pregnancy tests twice. I was wondering if anyone else experienced these type of warning dreams.,t3_i33dec
1407,Miscarriage,"I have PCOS, and have been told all my life that it would be next to impossible to conceive naturally. Untill March 30th this year I have never seen a positive pregnancy test. Honestly untill I saw those two pink lines I didn't realize I had given up hope, even though I fed my denial with temping, testing, charting and obsessing over ovulation day. My husband and I both come from very large, very fertile families, so for years we have watched it rain babies from under the proverbial umbrella. I am always excited for these relatives but with every pregnancy announcement there was that pang of heartache. When I told him it was finally our turn he fell into my arms and we cried in pure overwhelming joy. It felt so surreal at our 8 week appointment when we saw our sweet child moving inside me. The Dr pronounced every thing to be perfect and sent us on out blistful way. We got more excited as the weeks went on and at the 12 week mark I breathed a sigh of relief, as you always hear that's when the chance of miscarriage gets significantly lower. At 14 weeks we went to a private ultrasound company to find out the gender because our insurance wouldn't pay for second ultrasound untill 20 weeks. I was impatient and too excited to wait, I wanted to start buying and planning a nursery. We already had names chosen and on June 4th we found out our Ada was a stubborn little girl. It took 37 minutes exactly for her to move into a position where the tech could even see anything. I didn't mind in the least despite being desperate for a bathroom, I was drunk with watching her kick around. I bought a crib and  more clothes than she would probably wear but they were all so cute I couldn't help myself.  At our 16 week appointment everything still looked ""perfect"" even though I told my Dr I had some strange discharge that google told me was a mucus plug. She brushed it off and wanted to lecture me about sugar intake and my weight(which due to the PCOS I have watched closely for years) and covid. She didn't run any test or do any kind of exams. 2 weeks later I started feeling what I thought were growing pains. They didn't have any kind of consistency or rhythm to them so I went to bed and tried to relax. A few days later on July 2nd I woke up at 3am to a gush of fluid. In a panic I called and woke my Dr up and was told to come in the next morning around 9. An ultrasound confirmed that I had lost most of the amniotic fluid but she still had a strong heartbeat and was advised to go on bed rest and come in weekly. I went to bed and woke up that afternoon vomiting with a fever of 102.9. when my husband called the office he was told due to covid they wouldn't see me and I'd have to go to my regular Dr or the ER. My regular Drs office happens to also run a walk in clinic, so that's where we went. It was a short visit as my blood pressure was 60/100 and my pulse was 177 he immediately called for an ambulance and sent me to the hospital. I was dehydrated and had some kind of infection that I'm still not sure of because I had zero symptoms of infection untill that afternoon. After fluids, antibiotics and another ultrasound showing movement and a heartbeat, I was feeling much better, untill the contractions started around 10pm. And at 1:51am on July 3rd my 7.5 oz baby girl was on my chest. As the midwife was cutting her cord after ahe was born, she asked me ""mama do you want your baby?"" And I remember thinking what a stupid f**king question, of course I want her. She was so beautiful. She had my nose and her daddys feet, and the tiniest ears I had ever seen. We brought her home and buried her in the cemetery where we will one day be. I can't help but feeling like my ob/gyn let me slip through the cracks. Looking back I feel like there were so many signs she missed. I trusted her wholeheartedly to take care of me and this could have been prevented. I honestly don't know if that's true or a product of my grief needing to place blame somewhere. I should be ordering diapers and baby shoes but instead I've had to order a headstone. One thing I didn't expect was my milk to come in. That was a hard blow.  Our hearts are more than broken. It's been a month now and while my body has physically healed, I still cry nearly everyday for what should have been.",t3_i2soic
1408,Miscarriage,"   I had my miscarriage a while ago, actually what would have my baby's first birthday is coming up at the end of the month. I live with my bf and his family. It gets harder everyday cause my bfs sister is several weeks pregnant, and that's all I hear about. My mental health has been really good the past few weeks though, rarely thought about the miscarriage. But today broke me.

   Everytime I bring up trying again with my bf, he says he wants to wait till we're both financially stable. Which is completely understandable. But theres a part of me that thinks what if he never feels like we're ready. I scared were going to move out and we both have jobs and ill be waiting 10 years before he brings it up.

   My period is about to be a month late, the past few weeks half the things I eat make me nauseous, and I've had a horrible headache for about a week. All signs of another pregnancy i thought. Had my appointment today and it was negative.

   The thing that really bothers me is that for the past week while we were waiting for my appointment and suspecting pregnancy, my bf seemed alittle excited. At the time when I thought it was pregnancy, he would encourage me and tell if I was pregnant we would figure everything out and make it work and that everything would be ok. Him saying that made me not feel nervous anymore, it made me want to be pregnant even more. We would have all the moral support we could ask for from his family and him and i would take on parenthood together.

   But when we got the results back it crushed me. And he feels bad to. I'm not sure if its cause he feels bad cause I feel this way, or if he wanted it to be positive test results to. Im just not sure how to feel about how he'll not really talk about trying again without getting worked up about it, but when its unplanned he'll look on the bright side. Rn I just want that hole in my heart from the baby I lost to be filled. And I wish my bf can see that. I'm sure if it were to happen we would work it out and make things great. But I dont want to stress him out by bringing it up again.",t3_i3c0h6

I've found out my  SIL's baby was born without a heartbeat last night and I'm floundering to make this in any way easier for them. 

He was their first baby but not the first grandchild on either side of the family. Neither was she the first to lose  their first little one after birth this year in our side of thd family. How can I make things any way easier for my SIL and brother?

What were the things people did or said that helped either you or your partner. Or what did they fail to do/say, so it would be easier to avoid?

They are still at the hospital and I am at their place to feed their cat. They won't be out til wednesday. 

I'm going to clean up their place a bit because cat and the whirlwind of their trip to the hospital, but I asked and so I am not touching any of their baby things.

If there are any partners who lost a baby here, I would like to hear about what helped you too. I want to be as useful as possible. I don't want to make this about me in any way.

I’m too afraid to take a pregnancy test because I know that if it’s positive it’s more than likely that I have leftover hcg in my system from the miscarriage.

I wasn't very far along. I didn't know my baby. I never saw my baby on an ultrasound. We weren't currently trying for a baby.

But my baby existed. My baby was inside of me. I knew he was there before the test even came up positive. I felt my baby, knew he was growing inside me. I knew he was safe.

And now he's gone. My baby is gone before I ever got to see him.

I already built the space in my heart for him. And now that space is empty, and my body is empty, and I don't know what to do now.

I'm devastated. I can barely get through a day. It's been a week and every day is just as painful as the last. My reaction may be disproportionate to the loss, but that was my baby. And he is so beloved. And I am so heartbroken.",t3_i2o0jo

So when I text to check, she says the most painful thing, “she’s great, heartbeat exactly where it needs to be.” And I’m unsure if she somehow didn’t see how this would hurt me.

Then she heads off on a myriad of extreme sporting outings, including one where she brags about almost falling off of a cliff while backpacking.

I will never be able to feel that invincible again, and it’s something those who haven’t had the experience will never understand. You feel no control, and I would never brag about risking my life just to prove I could do it.

Hubs thinks I miscarried, but around that same time when I started bleeding is when I took a pregnancy test and it was negative.

Or is this simply a chemical malformation of cells. I don’t know how to feel about this. Should I mourn the loss of a child or be strong move on and try again. The pain is so intense also it’s been 36 hours since it started. This is the worst thing I have ever been through in my life.,t3_i2d1cq
1419,Miscarriage,"This one will be a long one, please bear with me. 

It started 4 days ago while I was at work. I got some cramps. It would be early for my period, but I haven't ever had a consistent period schedule my whole life. Nothing major, just some mild cramping. Next day, it's more intense, and I went to the bathroom periodically because I was worried I would start my period and didn't want to leak, and nothing was ever there. Not even a faint spot. Mild confusion, but like I said, I'm not normal with my periods, so nothing really alarming to me. 

Day before last, I got it in my head to take a pregnancy test. I figure there is no way in heck that it'll be positive, but ohwell.. I take it, and it's positive. I figured it was unreliable because the test (although not past its best by date) was old. My husband runs to the store in the morning to get new ones. I take the new one around noon yesterday, and it's positive. Alright, so two positives. I'm skeptical still, but figured okay cool. Well, cramping gets worse, wakes me up 4 times in the night. 

Today, I decided to try to make an appointment with my doctor. He sends me straight to ER. They do a urine test and a blood test. Doctor never came in to tell me the results, but next thing I know, I'm being taken down to get a CT scan. In my head, I'm thinking ""aren't you not supposed to get those or something if you're pregnant?"" The two nurses are talking over me, and must have figured the doctor already told me that the urine test came back negative. (Cue my heart sinking.) The CT nurse asked twice, ""are we absolutely sure that we are doing the CT and she is negative?"" My nurse said yes, but she will go check again just to be sure. She comes back 3 minutes later and said ""yes, the urine test was negative, so let's do the ct.""

Ct nurse gets me into position, and goes to get everything started, and my nurse comes running back into the room and tells her the doctor said to stop because the blood results haven't come back yet, and he wants to be sure since I had two positive home tests. So they wheel me back into the room. The doctor comes in and says, ""I have a negative urine test, but your blood results aren't in yet. When they come back to get you for a CT, you'll know if they're negative and I want to do a ct on your pelvic area to find out just what's going on."" I said okay, and waited, and hoped like heck they wouldn't come get me. 

They came and got me, and I almost cried on the way to my CT, but I held it together. Ct nurse gets me into position, gets everything hooked up to my IV to get it ready for the contrast, and gets a phone call. She tells me that I will not be getting a CT scan today. My nurse comes rushing back into the room to wheel me back to my room and says, ""they can't tell if you're pregnant or miscarrying, so we are going to send you for an ultrasound."" All I said was okay.  

Next the doctor comes in and says, ""your HCG levels are elevated but only slightly. There will be no further testing today. No ultrasound.  I want you to come get blood work in 48 hours. Your HCG levels will double every 12 hours. If they are raised above where you are now, you are pregnant. If they drop, we need to prepare you for your miscarriage. "" They gave me my discharge papers and of course instructions of if it gets to where you can't handle the pain or start bleeding, come to ER. 

Throughout today, my cramps were very, very mild. On the way home, I started to get them pretty bad but wanted to try to... feel what is going on if that makes sense. 

I didn't let my body tense from the pain, and just felt it, focusing on where it hurt. My description of pain is this, and I hope it makes sense:

The area feels like when I'm about to start bleeding on my period, AND it feels like it is trying to push down and out.... like my body is trying to get rid of something... 

I'm sitting in limbo, not sure of whether I'm having this miscarriage, but I have this gut feeling I am. I don't really know how to feel about this at all. This would be my first pregnancy.  Part of me wants to stay hopeful and just hope this passes and everything is fine, but the bigger part of me just knows that I'm going to miscarry. I would be about 3 weeks along. 

I don't know how to feel, what to do with myself, etc. Any advice, experience, anything is greatly appreciated. And if you read through this whole thing, thank you for taking the time to do so.",t3_i2o0b8

I went to my first ultrasound appointment two weeks ago when I was supposed to be 8w+5d pregnant and my baby was measuring only at 6 weeks.

It was extremely painful (way more than I expected) and I regret not deciding to do the D&amp;C. But I think the worst is over (still bleeding a little though). 

Before I took the Miso my HCG levels were at 25,000 and I had another test done this past Thursday and they are at 2,900. The doctor told me to come back in 7-10 days to see where they are at. 

Is this normal? How long should it take for my levels to go back to 0? I want to start trying as soon as I can but this waiting is driving me crazy.

1423,Miscarriage,"I’m posting this on mobile, and I’ve heard that sucks for formatting so apologies. 

Just as a foreword, this all happened about a year ago. I just found this group and it made me feel so much better about still grieving and not being able to get over it immediately, and I was just hoping you guys might have some advice for me.

About a year ago, I was considering breaking up with my ex (we’ll call him K) when I found out I was pregnant. As far as I know I was about two months along. I took a home pregnancy test and didn’t have the chance to go to the doctor. 

I struggled with what to do for about a week (we had discussed having kids before, and we both wanted them. We had even decided that in the even of an unexpected pregnancy we would both want to keep it. (As an aside, I don’t personally think I could have an abortion, and I would have been keeping the baby if I broke off the relationship or not.)

Before I could decide anything, or tell anyone, I miscarried. 

I broke it off with K in the aftermath, still having not told him what happened. (I know that was unfair, but I hadn’t told ANYONE. I just wanted to be alone with my grief.)

Also, K is a pretty stoic and cold person, and that was a lot of the reason it wasn’t working out with us, that’s not an excuse for not telling him then, but I wasn’t sure how. 

Fast forward two months. 

I was an emotional wreck, dealing with the end of my first major relationship and my miscarriage. 

I got it together enough to realize I had to tell him what happened or it would be too late, and I felt he deserved to know and would want to know. I felt like I would have wanted to know. 

(A little backstory, we went to high school together and almost all our friends were mutuals, so we still saw each other then and we still see each other now.) 

I texted him and asked if I could talk to him, he agreed and he drove me to a park near where I grew up. It’s not completely deserted but it’s a good hour drive to a place with a grocery store. 

I told him what happened and he was just totally silent. No response. I tried asking him if he needed to talk or had anything to say. I told him I was sorry and asked if he was angry at me, still nothing. He eventually says he feels “nothing” and that it’s time for him to take me home.
I was sitting on the ground crying, and he was sitting on a swing several feet away, he tried to get up and come touch me, and I kinda flinched away and wouldn’t let him. 

I didn’t know how to explain it then but my body felt like someone else’s grave, it still does sometimes. And I didn’t want him touching that grave if he felt nothing. 

(I’ve realized with time that he was probably hurting as much as I was, and that was why he told me he felt “nothing.”) 

We ended up in a fight (our only one ever that resulted in a screaming match) because I would not get in the truck with him and let him take me home. He ended up leaving me at the park and I guess I called a friend cause she showed up when it was getting dark and drove me to her place. 

Over the next couple weeks we stop contacting each other (I think that talk was the final straw on a pretty toxic relationship) 

It hurt, but it also helped, and I was starting to move on with my life a bit, when I found out from a mutual friend that he was going around our friend group telling people I had faked the miscarriage to manipulate him or get back together with him. 

I broke down. I had the horrible realization of why the few friends I had tried to confide in looked so suspicious of my story. It wasn’t in my head, people really were looking at me like I was lying about one of the worst things that has every happened to me. 
Like I would make public my body’s betrayal for fun. 

I tried to talk to him about it again only once, after I had gotten together with my current partner (G) when we were both hanging out at a mutual friend’s place. K also had a new partner by this time. 

We went out on the street for a smoke, and I congratulated him on his relationship (his new girlfriend is the cousin of my lifelong best friend, she’s a cool person and I like her) and made small talk for a minute. 

Then I told him that I really didn’t wanna be in conflict anymore, I just wanted to all be friends again, and that to do that I needed him to look me in the eye and tell me he knows I’m not a liar, and I wasn’t lying about this. 

He stormed away, and we haven’t spoken since. 

However, we still attend pretty much all the same social events, and we’re actually dating into the same family (we’re dating cousins, but still) 

He hasn’t had to face a single consequence, or lost a single friendship because of this. Everyone acts like he’s a great guy and nothing ever happened. 

I’ve tried to bring it up once or twice with different friends and pretty much get told to “get over it and move on” if they even seem to believe me at all. 
They all seem to thing I’m hung up on my past relationship and not the miscarriage, which I feel is pretty untrue. I definitely feel things for the guy, but mostly pity and dislike. 

It’s just gotten to a point where I don’t want him around. He comes over to our house at least once a week to see other members of the friends group who live with me and G and I just hide in the bedroom. 

I don’t feel like I can tell anyone what happened without feeling like a liar, he has truly caused me a lot of grief and struggle. At the same time, I don’t want to be the person who starts conflict or fucks up the friendships of the people around me. 

Every time a new person comes into the group I’m beside myself wondering what they know about me. If they think I’m the worst type of lair. It’s awful. 

What can I do?

I know it’s dumb to think that now. Me and my boyfriend seemed to be okay after but after a month I found out he was cheating with a mutual friend so I moved back home. I thought we’d be okay and come back stronger but no. My aunt had her baby 9 days ago and I was okay but I just found out my 15 year old sister is pregnant. All the stuff from my aunts new born will go to her. I’m here with my aunt and mom celebrating the baby and they keep talking about how sister can have this and this can be unisex. I’m trying to stay positive and be happy, we’re over the shock, but I keep having this ugly head of jealousy in the back of my mind. Am I a bad person for feeling this way?

1428,Miscarriage,"Hi, I have a couple of questions for this wonderfully supportive community. First, some background. I miscarried my first pregnancy naturally last month at 8 weeks, though baby only measured closer to 6 weeks. I had low progesterone (8.4 when around 5weeks) so took oral supplement from that point on for the 3 remaining weeks but of course it didn’t lead to viable pregnancy. In asking my OB what options I have to help prevent a future miscarriage due to low progesterone, she said just because my levels were low in this pregnancy does not mean they will be low in future pregnancy. Has this been true for anyone? 

She suggested I closely monitor to find out I’m pregnant even earlier and I can then get on progesterone 2-3 weeks earlier. I asked about getting on the supplement once we start TTC and she said no, not recommended because it affects dating (irregular periods, ovulation). For those who suspected or determined low progesterone led to their miscarriage, what has been your experience and your OBs proposed solution?

My HCG levels are now at 12 so I am hopeful I will have my period soon and be able to TTC again later this month. (OB recommended I wait 1 period cycle). I’m 37 so no time to waste. I am looking into getting a second professional opinion but would also really love to hear if anyone had a similar experience here.",t3_i1tz65

- Had sex a few more times after without taking any contraception or Plan B, but used the pull-out method.
- Between 5 July - 13 July, I spotted blood.
- On 13 July, I had the most awful pain in my legs and back. Much more painful than my usual PSM. I was super fatigued, haven’t felt such exhaustion in my life before. I basically couldn’t move the whole day and I was bleeding heavily from my vagina. The blood looked different than my usual period blood. Bleeding lasted a few days.
- Haven’t taken a pregnancy test yet.
- I feel completely normal now. No symptoms of pregnancy.",t3_i21qc0
1430,Miscarriage,"I had a very strong positive pregnancy test when I was a week late. At 6 weeks 5 days I was spotting and by 7 weeks I was bleeding quite badly for me but not so badly I needed an A&amp;E visit, no pain or cramping. I rang the GP who said ring the early pregnancy unit. The epu said there was no point scanning me this early because they might not see anything anyway, to give it a few days and see how the bleeding progresses. By nearly 8 weeks I had bled for three days and had awful cramps and lower back pain. I rang the EPU again and she said if the bleeding and pain had stopped there wasnt anything they could do so just take a test in two weeks and if its positive call back. One weeks later the test is negative 
Now I get that there's nothing that can be done for the pregnancy, I miscarried I understand that. But do I not need a check? I'm still feeling utterly exhausted, dizzy and sick. How do they know it's all cleared and back to normal? 
I know about 4 people who have all been scanned before 8 weeks and everything online is telling me to go in. I'm in the UK so dont even have a midwife yet. I feel abandoned",t3_i1wjv5

It took us 9 months to get pregnant the first time. I’m now 36 and he is 44.

I wasn’t expecting to get pregnant again so quickly, but I did test this month at 10dpo on a whim and it came back negative. I spotted the next day, and then my period started a bit early a few days later - but just didn’t stop.

This morning I decided to do a test as I am on day 15 of bleeding which is not normal for me; positive. Bloods confirmed it with HCG of 78. Back in two days to test again.

I’m super bummed. I guess I’m glad it didn’t take so long again, and that I didn’t get further along before loss, but fuck this is hard.

I can’t help but feel hopeless and that I’m doomed to continue losing pregnancies now.

1434,Miscarriage,"I had a MMC at 9 weeks. Took the miso pills on Tuesday - had no idea the pain/chills/vomiting/bleeding/cramping would be so severe. The severity lasted about four hours, after that I had bad cramping and bleeding but could get up and walk around.

Fast forward to today. I’ve still been bleeding pretty heavily, sometimes some thicker blood/clots, and I’ve been getting feelings of lightheadedness almost like I’m going to pass out. yesterday I felt like my circulation wasn’t working properly, like my limbs had the circulation suppressed. It’s very spooky and I’m not sure if it’s related to the miscarriage or something else. I’ve been working very long 10 hour days on my feet the whole time, so I know that’s not helping.

If anyone who is reading this will be taking miso, I really recommend taking time off work if you can. I couldn’t afford to, but I think it would’ve helped. 

Has anyone else had any experiences like this? When did the heavy bleeding and abdominal discomfort stop? It’s so overwhelming to be in such heavy emotional pain and also physical symptoms too. It feels like my body is grieving with me. Although the medication has been difficult, I wouldn’t go back and change it if I could.

1435,Miscarriage,"This is sort of an AITA (am I the asshole). I have two sisters-in-law and one sister who all have children. I've been dealing with my miscarriage since the weekend of July 17. I just had a D&amp;C yesterday after my medicated MC failed. My snapchat is clogged with a bunch of unopened snaps from my husband's sister, who loves sending videos of her toddler playing. We did my dad's birthday virtually on zoom last weekend, where all my nieces and nephews had cute t-shirts that said ""I heart my grampie"" on them. My mother mercifully warned me that she had ordered these shirts and I was ready to brace myself for that, and I powered through several hours of interacting with these kids online.

I must have done a really great job portraying that I was not bothered by this, because the day of my procedure, my brother's wife sent me two videos of my niece playing the piano. She sends me these sometimes because I'm the only other pianist in the family and I love providing encouragement for her. I didn't play them because I knew they would upset me. Then today she pressed me on it, saying my niece wanted to know if I'd seen the videos she sent. Since she pressed me, I responded saying that I'm very proud of my niece and want her to know I love her very much, but I'm not ready to go through 2 mins of piano video right now. I'm just too sad.

This particular SIL has had miscarriages as well, and I was surprised that she would press me on whether I exposed myself to videos of her beautiful lovely pianist. AITA for explicitly asking for space? I feel so terrible.",t3_i1ge10

1445,Miscarriage,"Hello all. I had my first miscarriage in January at 5+6. Although it was early it was very sad. This pregnancy seemed to be going great- my 8 week scan looked amazing! I wasn’t supposed to go back in until 13 weeks but I opted for an extra appt at 10+4 because I was nervous. Well I’m really glad I opted for that appointment because unfortunately yesterday they discovered the baby stopped growing at 10 weeks. 

They scheduled me an “emergency” d&amp;c for later today, and I am extremely nervous. I’m more nervous that I am just going to feel nauseous and sick, that they are going to put me under, and that because of covid, my husband can’t be there at all. I’m scared. I’m more worried about this than I am sad about the actual miscarriage I think. 

Thankfully my doctor offered to do the chromosome testing to see what went wrong, but this is also making me feel anxiety. I think I just want to move on with this and get back to my “normal” life post pregnancy, considering this was try #2, and hearing “this went wrong” (even if it’s not my fault) might make me feel bad/sad. Does anyone have any advice about the expectations of this testing, or what kind of results I might get or how long after the procedure? Or some encouragement that the d&amp;c is not that bad?

Mentally I would It say I’m doing great considering, and I see a psychologist so that has helped dramatically. However, it doesn’t help that my sister, who’s pregnant and trying to be supportive, went on and on about “how rare” it must be to have a MMC this late, and we haven’t even told our in-laws because last time I had a miscarriage all my MIL said was “thanks for trying” and my SIL accused me of not taking prenatals.

Yesterday, after the procedure, I actually felt okay.  Overall it wasn't as horrible as I expected, the bad part was over pretty quick, and my mental state afterwards felt at peace.  I told myself that it was fine - that I would eventually have a child and this will all be worth it.  I figured I'd come into work the following day.

It was obviously a difficult day, and I'm happy I didn't have to work.  Taking the medical route (at home medications, not a D&amp;C) to kickstart the process, I went back to work the next day.  The physical pain caught me by surprise at times and while in some ways it was nice to have my work to distract me and keep me busy, I was suffering emotionally, as well.

I have a friend at my work in HR and I shared with her what happened, asking how that scenario should have gone, given no coworkers knew I was pregnant.

She initially suggested taking a sick day.  As I explained, a miscarriage straddles sick leave and bereavement, when you return, you aren't 100%.  I also didn't want to field well-meaning questions about what kept me home.  I've anonymously asked that our Benefits team look at offering bereavement (3 days) for miscarriages, for both affected partners.  The scripted line we are encouraging employees and managers to use/understand is 'I've suffered a loss and I will be taking bereavement leave, returning X date.'

I had my miscarriage 1.5 months ago. Sounds terribly short but I feel like months have passed. On my birthday, I passed out the two sacs that were supposed to be my first born twins. They were 6w along, and I had only seen them once during the ultrasound. 

My husband has been great, but I know he’s moved on (and I don’t blame him). I’ve read enough to know that this wasn’t my fault, but knowing and actually feeling it is completely different. I feel like I have failed my babies and I am so sorry. 

I read all these posts ranging from fresh grief to mommies who have mourned their unborn babies for years and I wonder - will it ever get better? I’m so sad of being sad, and so tired of this intense guilt hanging over me. All. The. Time. I wanted them so badly. 

Where did they go? Will I ever see them again? When will it get better? 

It’s just one of those nights.",t3_i0lsnb
1460,Miscarriage,"Has anyone dealt with a scenario with an incomplete miscarriage where the only thing that remains is a thickened lining? I also have a few very very small clots which are so small they can’t even measure. I am hoping it will just come out with my period and I won’t need to go down the surgical route. 



Just a note: My gyne is testing to see if it’s a new pregnancy but my heart tells me it isn’t.",t3_i0k97p

Pandora, you were my daughter 

if only we had found

green-eyed curiosity's

audacities abound


kicking heels and showing off

the pictures you had drawn

turning pirouettes and chasing 

bubbles across the lawn


You would grow your hair out 

Just to dye it pink and blue

And we could never fathom 

the unraveling of you


and all the world's best mysteries 

were in your heartbeat song

for only in that moment you were here

and you were gone


Shrodinger, you were my son

at least that's what we think

collecting stones beside the shore

to dye them blue and pink


racing round the living room

tugging at my dress

A constant state of motion

in a constant state of rest


building like an architect 

your tongue stuck out the side

the boxes always tumbled down

the harder that we tried


and all the world's best mysteries 

were in your heartbeat song

for only in that moment you were here

and you were gone",t3_i0630z
1463,Miscarriage,"Hi , I’m reaching out because I guess I don’t feel completely valid or am I’m still in denial about having a miscarriage . Sorry if it’s messy I’ve never written a post , I just feel so sad and filled with grief, confused , and alone. 

It started about 3-4 weeks ago when I started to suspect I was pregnant. I would feel nauseous when exercising, hormonally moody, I was physically fatigued in a way I’ve never really felt before which is odd since I have depression and know what it feels like to have less energy, and food aversion. I would have light cramping here and there but was not late for my period yet so just ignored it , but then the next week I started to have constant mild - moderate cramping , nausea, sore breasts, emotional and felt so tired for some reason . I began to worry because even though at the time I wasn’t sure it was pregnancy and I didn’t want to believe it , I could feel something was wrong with my body . I was afraid I had cancer or something I didn’t know . Especially what threw me off is for my body before I get my period I normally have light to no discharge . But I was having heavy, wet , milky discharge for like a week . It was freaking me out . 

I took two pregnancy tests that came out negative , but I also drank a shit load of water before and my urine was really clear .  I regret doing that so much. I guess I just wanted to speed up the process of knowing but I know now that it could have messed up my results . 

I felt so anxious and just off. 
Then after being late about 11-12 days , I started to spot this brown color . The next morning there was nothing in my pad but when I went to go pee , this huge clump was at the bottom of the toilet . I was concerned but just thought it must have accumulated??? I don’t know . 

I decided to try my birth control patch Because I had been waiting to start my period, but within a few hours I got the most HORRENDOUS pain in my lower back . I couldn’t sit or especially bend over . I was incredibly nauseous as well . My period was very clumpy but also on and off . I also had cramps . I just assumed it was the patch , I waited another day but the pain got progressively worse to where I was crying in pain and couldn’t get out of bed . I felt so awful . I took the patch off thinking that’s what it was . The cramping and the pain in my back eased a little and stopped for about a day , but here I am a week later still passing really dark brown blood that smells unusual with pressure and light pain in my back . 

I didn’t think of a miscarriage until last week my therapist asked if I was having one as I was describing and it slowly seeped in . I want another explanation , and I know it might sound stupid , but I just have this knowing . This deep feeling of loss, shock, and grief . I feel guilty , or like this is my fault I didn’t even know I was pregnant. A part of me is hoping to find another explanation  , but another has this grief that I lost my first child at 20 years old and I don’t know how to handle that .",t3_i0k46y
1464,Miscarriage,"Hi all, 

Looking for some advice. I’ve just experienced my 2nd Chemical Pregnancy in 4 months. We’ve been trying since last May/June. 

I have also had a previous loss with another partner in 2014 - although I think I could’ve been slightly further along on that one (maybe 6weeks?) 

So far we have both had private testing that seems normal - me an Ultrasound and him an SA. My 21 day bloods showed no sign of ovulation as I had a wonky cycle and ovulated a few days afterward. Normally 29 days and I have been tracking ovulation with OPK and Temps.

I have a referral for Gynae with the NHS but I would imagine their testing is likely to be similar to what we’ve already paid for. My doctor doesn’t seem to be concerned at these losses, but I am losing hope very quickly. Should I at least push for a new CD21 blood test to see if I might have low progesterone? 

Thanks.",t3_i0hga7
1465,Miscarriage,"I went to the ob/gyn today and my pregnancy was confirmed. However I had a heavy flow several days ago and severe back pain, signs of miscarriage. I was given an ultrasound which was very invasive, as medical instruments were inserted into my vagina, and the doctor told me there didn’t seem to be a heartbeat in the embryo, just my heartbeat. There’s still a chance everything is fine, as I’m very early on, but with all of the symptoms and the ultrasound I’m not optimistic. I was told that I could miscarry at any time, and that it will be bloody and painful. I think having to wait is the most stressful part of this. My family has been kind and supportive, but they have no conception of what I’m going through. I just don’t know what to feel, how to cope, and how to go on.",t3_i0dq21
1466,Miscarriage,"Hello everyone, I would really like some advice or would like to know if anyone has been through this before, I’m supposedly 9.5 weeks and I went for my first ultrasound today and all they saw was an empty sac they even did the transvaginal ultrasound and same thing, nothing. They gave me another appointment for next week to do another ultrasound but said it could be a failed pregnancy or a miscarriage, the paper they gave me for the ultrasound says missed miscarriage, I’m confused because I haven’t had any severe pain or any bleeding, I really don’t think I miscarried, so my question is if I go again to this appointment and it’s the same thing, should I wait and try another ultrasound, get a second opinion or go through the d&amp;c which I really don’t want to do. Any tips or advice would be great, please and thank you. 🤍",t3_i0cyjv
1467,Miscarriage,"Just thought this was super interesting. Had my 12 week apt Monday to find out baby stopped growing at 8 weeks. Had no spotting, no symptoms of miscarriage or anything up to that point. Literally right after my appointment I started spotting. I have a D and C tomorrow, but today I’m spotting worse and cramping. Just thought it was so interesting how once I mentally knew I had lost the baby, my body picked up on my thoughts and started recognizing the miscarriage.",t3_i02zlg

1469,Miscarriage,My miscarriage was a little over a week ago at 4 weeks and 3 days. I found out we were pregnant at 3 weeks 4 days.

1470,Miscarriage,"and I am a complete effing wreck. I can barely function. I am in touch with my doctor, on medicine and setting up counseling. I have never been through this. I don't know what to do on a due date but am thinking of ideas. Even my period is different due to stress I can tell it's the stress. I hope it ends by Sunday. 

I'm sorry this is all over the place. I had never been pregnant before. I had never been so happy before seeing them move and have a little heartbeat and everything. And then they were gone. And now I have empty arms and no baby. And the way it's been for me is everyone is there when you find out you're pregnant...and then they disappear when you're not anymore. I know some people don't know what to say or do but just a ""hey are you okay"" might be nice.

1471,Miscarriage,"Tw

I found out I was pregnant at 5 weeks. Everything was normal and healthy, had a general doctor confirm pregnancy at 6 weeks with blood work. Then had my first ultrasound at 10w4d (today). 
About a week ago my fiancé and I had sex, immediately after I started spotting. I had light spotting with 1-2 very small blood clots and a few small stringy tissue pieces when I wiped, never a need for a pad or liner. I called my doctor, they said this can be normal in pregnancies and since my appointment was in a few days to just come in then unless I start bleeding heavier. 
Today I went in and found out I had an empty gestational sac. It measured about 8w so it stopped growing a while ago. I was informed that I am going to be miscarrying but wouldn’t take any further medical steps until we got blood work back to confirm hcg levels. 
About 2 hours later, I started having period like cramps/bleeding and passed a lemon sized blood clot/tissue sac. I knew immediately that I really did miscarry. I called my doctor immediately and they confirmed what I described. 
 
I didn’t tell anyone about my pregnancy. This seemed like the best place to tell my experience as I read many of these in the week leading up to my ultrasound. It helped me prepare myself for what I thought would be happening when it actually did. I hope my story might help others as well",t3_hzt4kr

1478,Miscarriage,"Hi all-

I am experiencing my first miscarriage at 5w5d, so far as I can tell. Symptoms started Friday, I called the doctors Friday and they said to call back Monday with changes. I called the doctors early Monday,they said not to worry about it that bleeding, cramping, etc., are normal and I called back and spoke to the nurse twice to let them know that I was bleeding through a pad an hour, had no doubt in my mind that I was miscarrying, and asked for an appointment.  I eventually was able to schedule an appointment at a totally different clinic with a different doctor in the practice for Wednesday. Had labwork done Monday and received a phone call confirming my appointment today and had to correct that it was for a miscarriage not my first pregnancy intake - the nurse said, ""ok, I'm so sorry, I'll make a note, come on in tomorrow and we'll take good care of you.""  A few hours later, I received notifications today that I had messages in my online account for the doctor. The first message asked to have return bloodwork done because HCG was very low and I was either early in pregnancy or threatened miscarriage - I replied that I was certain it was a miscarriage, included some details, and asked if they would still like me to have bloodwork done - received a reply that said ""sorry to hear that, please call the clinic and reschedule your appointment for 2 - 3 weeks out."" 

Umm ok, I have a lot of questions - are things progressing as they should, when should I resume normal activity, etc., - my question to you all is - what would your approach be? Do I call and insist on an appointment? Are there certain questions I should be asking? Any advice for navigating this?",t3_hzrmgg

1481,Miscarriage,"I was about 8 weeks when I miscarried in May. My blood work showed I would of been about 5 weeks. Nothing was showing in the external but the internal showed what looked like a shadow. Dr said it was probably just to early to see. A few days later I was experiencing light cramping and spotting so I made another appointment and was able to get in 2 weeks  later. 4 days before my appointment I woke up from my sleep in the worst pain Ive ever had, I was passing clots and I could only assume I lost the pregnancy. Went to the appt and had an internal ultrasound, and doctor confirmed I MC. I asked if I needed a D&amp;C, doctor said no, it passed naturally and would have a week of bleeding and clots yet. My first period was pretty normal, just a little more heavy and bad cramps. 2nd period was july 5th to the 10th. 22 days later (yesterday), another period. My cramps are so bad im doubling over, dizzy, lightheaded and almost wanting to vomit. Im just wondering if this relatable to anyone in here?

I couldn’t quite understand how my dr explained it to me and the last person I told didn’t believe me and made me feel like I was just looking for attention.,t3_hzp2xd
1483,Miscarriage,"TL;DR - finding it hard to listen to logic that says nothing is wrong with me, don’t want to talk with my family about it, feeling pretty down about things at the moment. 

My molar pregnancy was confirmed as complete. I’d convinced myself it was a partial because my baseline hCG levels were at 33,000, which is not only normal for how far along I was at diagnosis but also much lower than what is usually found when it is complete. 

But I was wrong. 

A complete molar pregnancy. It happened because my egg was empty. Not because it was accidentally fertilized by two sperm, but because it contained no maternal DNA. Logically I know this was still just a fluke, but it was a lot easier to accept that it was purely bad luck when I believed that at least my egg was healthy. It was a lot easier to accept that there is nothing wrong with me, despite nothing to show for my two pregnancies besides two losses, when I believed that my egg was normal. 

It means fetal tissue never even started to develop, and there was never a baby in the first place. It means the chance that some cells stayed behind and will develop into a malignant cancer is now 15-20% instead of 5%. It means waiting six months after my hCG levels are negative to try again, at which point I will be 35 - when complications are more likely, when getting pregnant is harder, when the general population’s chances of a molar pregnancy are higher. And these are normal expectations. These don’t even take into account that I have PCOS, that I’ve now had two miscarriages, that the chance of having another molar pregnancy is now a bit higher. 

I was doing fine. I had accepted it. I had grieved. Now I just feel like I’m in a daze, with a lump in my throat and a burning behind my eyes. And the last thing I want to do is talk about it with anyone, even though all I want to do is cry to my mom, because my sister had a baby four days ago, and I want my family to fully enjoy feeling that new baby high. 

Let’s talk for a second about just how much that sucks, though. I mean, I am so happy for her of course. I love being an aunt and am so excited to have another nephew in the mix. And I know she had a hard time getting (and staying) pregnant, so I know it makes it that much sweeter. But I can’t deny that it really hurts to see the photos and see my family fawning all over this new bundle of joy when I just had my baby that was never even a baby scraped out of me four weeks ago. And I can’t deny that it really hurts to know how quickly my experience will be glossed over and forgotten as everyone rides the new baby wave. I know this because this same sister had her first baby shortly after my first miscarriage. So while I’m so happy and excited for her and her growing family, I’m so sad to know what the next few months will feel like for me. And I feel guilty and selfish for being sad about that. 

But mostly I just feel defeated. I dread being told that my time will come and it’ll happen for me. All I’ve ever wanted was to be a mom, and I’m starting to think it’s time to accept that it might not be in the cards for me.",t3_hzouy2
1484,Miscarriage,"I had a doctor appointment on Monday and learned the baby didn't have a heartbeat at 12 weeks.

I’m so worried that something “bad” will happen. Like it will be painful for me, emotionally difficult, etc. Did any of you experience this? Other than taking precautions about getting pregnant, is there anything else I should be aware of?

1488,Miscarriage,"The following post is going to be my miscarriage story. I've always found a lot of comfort in telling stories. I think it's how I cope with things, I tend to get suck in emotions until I can tell the story from start to end. I know I'll never forget about my baby but I think telling my story will help me to process my feelings and I'll be able to begin moving on. 

My husband and I had only been trying for one cycle in the hopes of having a second child. When I first got a positive home pregnancy test I could feel the adrenaline rush through me, feeling incredibly lucky that it happened so quickly. I told my husband straight away who was shocked (I don't really know why considering we were actively trying), nervous and excited. We started talking about names, and things we needed to buy, and buying and bigger house, and all the big and little things that come with a new child. I started to make a list on my phone of 'things to buy for the new baby'. I, like so many others who have never experienced  a miscarriage before, naively thought that a miscarriage would never happen to me. 

I waited a week after doing a home pregnancy test to see my doctor (GP). I had done 4 or 5 HPTs in the time and the second line that had started off barely visible was very slowly getting darker. I even had a 'yes' on a digital pregnancy test. I was beyond excited, even though I had terrible morning sickness and some complications with my first pregnancy. I knew all that was worth it. When I told my GP that I was pregnant she took me through all the usual things, including a urine pregnancy test. It came back negative. I felt the anxiety rising in me, a feeling I would become extremely intimate with over the following weeks. She asked me to get a blood test, gave me a referral for a dating scan and told me she would call me with the blood results and tell me if I should make the ultrasound appointment or not. 

As soon as I got the blood test I rushed home and took another home pregnancy test. When the result came back positive I felt reassured for a brief time, but quickly the doubt crept back in. I googled 'doctors urine test negative' and was reassured that the doctors tests were a lot weaker than the HPTs and that lots of women had had the same experience as me. Still, I thought, after a week surely the hCG would have risen enough for a positive? I tried to put it out of my mind until I received my blood test results the next day. 

""The results have come back positive, but it's very early so the doctor would like you to have a repeat in 48 hours"" the nurse told me over the phone.

""What was the number?"" I asked, not realising this would be the begining of my obsession with my beta hCGs.

""It was 80""

80 - only 80? At what should have been 18 DPO give on take a day or two. I'd been tracking my periods for 6 months and they have always been incredibly regular, so even though I didn't use an OPK I was pretty sure when I had ovulated. This is when I started googling, and searching on reddit. Trying to find any success story I could, and there were a lot. However, for every success story I found, I found just as many stories with devastating outcomes. I knew I needed to put the phone away and stop googling, but I just couldn't. I got my second blood test done on friday morning, so of course I knew I wouldn't be able to get the results until the Monday as my doctors office isn't open over the weekend. The 5 days between getting my first beta hCG and getting the results from my second are a complete blur. I basically went to work, came home and searched obsessively on my phone, and went to sleep. Rinse and repeat. Finally the nurse called with my second results.

""The bloods have gone up - your hCG level is now 180."" She said.

I should have been happy. Everything I'd read were that the levels only needed to double in 48 hours and mine had. I should have been reassured, but I wasn't. I still had this creeping feeling that things weren't right. I had this instinct that things weren't okay. The next day I started to have incredibly light brown spotting while at work. I went home and cried, I took the next day off work, and the the spotting just stopped. I tried to put it out of my mind. The key word here being TRIED.

Even thought the levels were increasing the doctor wanted me to have another test approximately one week after the first. I decided to go on Thursday morning, since I didn't want to have to wait the whole weekend for the results again. I was starting to feel hopeful. Maybe things could work out after all, after all I had read plenty of success stories of people with low beta hCGs and spotting. Maybe this was just a story I would tell one day when my child was throwing a tantrum or acting out as a teenager. I imagined myself saying ""I knew right from the start this one was going to be trouble!"". 

On Thursday evening I started bleeding. 

My heart sank. We're my worst fears coming true? At this point I was just so exhausted. I hadn't been eating, I was constantly full of anxiety, and I was just so tired all the time. My friends tried to reassure me, some of them had bleeding during their pregnancy and everything turned out okay. Those who had experienced miscarriages urged me not to let their stories affect my hope. Nothing reassured me, it wasn't them, it was me. I know my body and I know what being pregnant feels like, and I didn't feel it. 

I took a warm shower and went to bed, the cramping had started at that point but it wasn't too bad and the bleeding was still light. I woke up Friday morning and things started to get worse. I found the number online for the Early Pregnancy Assessment and Management Service and decided to give them a call. They had one appointment left and told me to come in and have a consultation and ultrasound. 

I was anxious before the ultrasound, it was my first for this pregnancy. The ultrasound technician was lovely, she talking to me about my work and helped to distract me from the uncomfortable experience that is the transvaginal ultrasound. 

I'll never forget during my first pregnancy, seeing my daughter for the first time. I already loved her but seeing her little heart beating during that first ultrasound was a feeling I'll never forget. I got to see her and in a lot of ways it felt like the first time I got to meet her. I didn't get that this time. The ultrasound technician said my uterus was empty. There was nothing there. No baby, no heart beat, just a slightly thickened uterine lining. 

I got dressed and went to see the doctor, my heart was heavy. I have to be honest with you, at this point I was just so tired that I wanted it to be over. In my heart I knew that my baby was already gone, and I only wish that I had had the chance to see him. However, because there was nothing on the ultrasound I was officially classified as a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). 

I felt so defeated. I just wanted off this ride. My hCG from the day before had come back as only 410 - a 50% increase in 6 days. I was bleeding and cramping. I just wanted to be told my baby was gone so I could finally let go of any hope that this pregnancy could work out. The doctor told me about the warning signs for ectopic pregnancy and to come back to ED if I had any. She told me to come back for another blood test on Monday. She told me to look after myself this weekend.

On Saturday the pain got worse. It felt like labour, or afterbirth pains. I started bleeding even heavier and passing large clots. It was still manageable but I finally allowed myself to let go of hope and begin grieving. 

It was incredibly difficult to look after my toddler. I felt all this sadness and pain and I just wanted to sleep, and yet toddlers demand attention. By the end of the day I was so exhausted I yelled at her. She didn't deserve it. I asked my husband to take her and I cried in the shower. I cried long and hard. I didn't feel like I deserved my toddler, I felt like I didn't deserve another baby. 

My toddler was inconsolable. I was inconsolable. I got out of the shower and I held her, while my husband held both of us, and we cried until she was asleep. Then my husband held me and I cried some more. We did what we could to get through the rest of the weekend.

Monday morning came and I got my blood test. Hospitals on Monday morning are a nightmare! The pathology collection was so busy I waited an hour for my blood test and then another three hours for the results to come back. The EPAMS was full of women, which broke my heart. I wish no one else would have to experience this. None of us really made eye contact in the waiting area. The nurse kept apologising for the wait, we all said it was okay, we all thanked her for keeping us updated. Eventually the nurse asked me if instead of waiting to see the doctor I just wanted her to give me my results. I said yes. 

She told me my hCG levels had gone down to 50. I was thankful.. I'd been so sad for so long, so uncertain. All I could feel in that moment was relief. I felt guilty. What kind of person is thankful their very much wanted pregnancy is over? The nurse reassured me, my feelings were okay, they were understandable. That it was okay. She was so kind, she talked to me about all the things I needed to know. I told her I understood. We talked for a while about how even though I didn't get to see my baby, he was still loved. She gave me a bear to keep, he's next to me now. I was so thankful for something to remember my baby by. I told her I didn't even know this service existed, but how thankful I was. It takes a special person to do a job like that. She got me a doctors certificate for the rest of the week off work and because I was PUL they want my results to come back as less than 5. I hope since it's gone down so quickly so far that I'll only have to get one more blood test. 

I was 6 weeks and 1 day when I lost my baby. I'd only know I was pregnant for 2 weeks and 4 days but I loved him every day of those two weeks. We're going to try again after my next period, but I know that no future baby can ever replace this baby and I know I'll never forget him.",t3_hz809f

1490,Miscarriage,"Hello,
I'm new here, but already read a lot within last few days.
I was hoping someone here could help me figure out what to expect. I'm worried sick, and don't know what to do.

I tested early, so I knew I'm pregnant. However, last test was very faint, and I started feeling lower back pain and cramps, along with very light brownish spotting. I went to ER to rule out ectopic. They did an ultrasound and didn't see an embryo, but they did see my body was getting ready for pregnancy (thicker layer of something?). I was told to do a follow-up bloodwork in 48 hours. They also said it's most likely MC because my hcg was only around 20.

Is it considered a chemical pregnancy? 

Right now I'm in bed, scared, not knowing what's next. I noticed first signs of period (brighter red), but I guess it's normal in this case? Is there going to be a sac at all? Doc didn't see an embryo on ultrasound. 

I have PCOS, and my periods are usually heavy, with clots, so I'm not even sure what's the signs of having to go to ER.

Also, thank you for sharing your stories! I can only imagine how difficult it might be, but it helps tremendously.",t3_hzlzcc
1491,Miscarriage,"After weeks of pinning maternity outfits and meal prep ideas, pregnancy workouts, nursery inspo, baby registry must-haves, etc. it’s all over my feed and I cant stand it.

I had my d&amp;c today after a missed miscarriage at 8weeks. 

Does it get easier to see these reminders in the media?",t3_hz7yyr
1492,Miscarriage,"This happened in December/January, but it’s still bothering me and hasn’t been fully resolved.

I thought I miscarried in December at 8 weeks, only three days after my first ultrasound.  I had some sudden heavy bleeding, not accompanied by any paid or sustained bleeding.  I freaked out and called the on call doctor since it happened on a Sunday.  She told me I could go to the ER but there isn’t anything they can do.  Instead, she suggested I call the office first thing Monday morning and ask for a same day appointment.  

When I got there, I told this doctor (who was not my normal doctor and was clearly very young) that I think I miscarried the day before and I described what happened.  She said I “most likely” miscarried and I could have an ultrasound to confirm, but she recommended against it because she thought it would be traumatic for me to see an empty uterus just days after my first ultrasound.  So not knowing any better, I took her advice and didn’t have the ultrasound.  She did a quick pelvic exam to see “if anything was still there” and said she didn’t see anything.  So I left the doctor thinking I had a miscarriage.  

Fast forward a month, I think I’m having a normal period.  Then it intensifies into an incredibly painful experience with very heavy bleeding (soaking through a pad every 20 minutes).  I had no idea what was happening.  My husband took me to the ER, where we learned there were still “products of conception “ that were naturally expelling from my body.  They have me two doses of morphine and I could still feel the pain.  They were stunned that my doctor didn’t offer any kind of pill or D&amp;C to take care of this, or even warn me to expect the natural passing.  

This was a very scary and traumatic experience for both my husband and I - I had no idea what was happening!  I had no idea to expect something like this!!  I feel like my doctor was negligent by not explaining my options and not explaining what to expect, and also not adequately confirming that I had passed the products of conception when I saw her in December.  I think it’s entirely possible that I didn’t have a miscarriage in December and I could have been more cautious and done things differently to prevent the full miscarriage.  Am I wrong?  Any thoughts are welcome.",t3_hz3y6h
1493,Miscarriage,How worried should I be about scar tissue forming after a D and C? I was googling and found something that said “the best way to prevent Asherman’s is to avoid D and C” which scared me and made me think it wasn’t a good decision?,t3_hzgkvg
1494,Miscarriage,"As the title says, I am currently (almost) 8 weeks post d&amp;c for an anembryonic pregnancy and still haven't got my period. I had a couple of days of cramping 2 weeks ago that felt very much like period pain but nothing came from it. I was instructed to wait until after my first period before TTC again but didn't expect it to take this long. My cycle was a regular 26 days before this.
Should I make an appointment with my doctor to investigate or wait a little longer?",t3_hza5yc
1495,Miscarriage,"Last week I was diagnosed with having a blighted ovum  which is an early sign of pregnacy loss and basically I have a placenta and gestational sac but the embryo doesnt grow. So no baby was growing inside it. I was given pills known as misoprostol and that within a week the gestational sac and placenta should come our, within 3 hours of taking the first 3 pills (7/23) the gestational sac came out then 2 days ago (7/25) the placenta came out. But today (7/27) something else came out of me and it looks like it was a baby. I'm confused since I was told no baby was inside me but this looks like one. Should I go to the hospital? Or should I call my doctor. I am very confused. I am bleeding right now but not as much.",t3_hz75vj
1496,Miscarriage,"My husband and I started trying for a baby 2 months ago. It took us almost 18 months to conceive our first so we wanted to get a head start on the process. On July 23, the day my period was due I got two positive pregnancy tests, a cheapie and a FRER. We were over joyed. Because we were trying I had a box of cheapie test strips, I took another one the next day - no change in the darkness. On the 25th I took another FRER and it was much lighter, my cheapie was almost negative. I went to the doctor and got betas. They were 16 on the 25th and 16 again on the 27th. The doctor confirmed it was a very early miscarriage but we would be able to start trying again once I got a “true period”.

I haven’t started bleeding yet and I’m wondering when I can expect it. It’s so hard to know my pregnancy isn’t viable but that I haven’t even started the process of losing it yet. 

I just feel like a failure. I told a few family members and it was horrible to take that excitement away from them, I feel stupid and I feel like my body has failed me. 

Any advice or what to expect is greatly appreciated, I thought the TWW was hard, waiting to pass an unwanted pregnancy with no clear end in sight is worse.

1499,Miscarriage,"Sorry in advance as this is going to be long, but there's a lot to explain.

My last period started may 10th, then june rolls around, but my period doesn't. Went on a quick weekend trip to the beach and planned to take a HPT when we got home as I was 2 weeks late by then.  While still on our trip bf and I went to dinner and when we went to leave there was blood on my leg, so I went to the bathroom and there was a mess and once I looked it up determined I had a miscarriage, this was June 19th.  I didn't have any serious cramping or any bleeding at all leading up to it, so it completely caught me off guard.

We get home and I am just extremely exhausted still and have no energy whatsoever, but assumed it was just my body leveling back out after the miscarriage. After more than 3 weeks of this I decided I would schedule my annual physical with my PCP to get blood work and make sure it wasn't anything serious.  I get to the appointment and she asks me to explain everything that happened with my MC , so I did and she says it sounds exactly like one, but you urine test is showing bright positive. So she has me do my blood work on the way out to check my hcg levels and also to see if there's anything else going on.  She calls me the next day to go over my results where she tells me my blood work is still showing positive for pregnancy.  When I looked at my results online it showed my level was most 75000.  She had me schedule an appointment with my OB to figure out what was going on.   
This was on July 18th and my appointment is scheduled for today 7/28 to see my OB.  Well last night I was laying down with my son to put him to bed and when I got up I went to the rest room and the same thing as my first MC happened again.  

Has anyone had this happen before?  I know its possible to be twins, but I'm just so confused and overwhelmed with all of this. I'm hoping to get some answers at my appointment and that I don't have some serious condition going on that I don't know about that might make me unable to try again.

I hope this made sense.",t3_hz9aj2
1500,Miscarriage,"  

On July 6, 2020, my HCG was 220 

On July 17th at 11:00 a.m. my HCG was down to 70

On July 17th at 6:00 p.m. my HCG was down to 50

On July 21st my HCG was 19

I've continued to get positive HPT and my doctor told me last week to take another HPT today to ""make sure it is negative as it should be."" So I just took a test and the test line is darker than last week? I called my doctor to report and the nurse just said ""oh well test again next week then."" 

If it was at 19 a week ago, why would it be an even darker positive on a HPT now? Every time I've spoken with my doctor I've begged her to check and make sure that nothing is left in there and she just dismisses it and says ""if it was an ectopic there would be other signs"" but I don't think ectopic is the only concern. I tried going to an urgent care and they basically said the same thing. No one will check or give me any explanation for what is going on. 

I don't think it is possible for me to have ovulated since the MC started on July 17th (only 10 days ago) and I've been taking OPKS without any positives. It seems really unlikely that I would mc, conceive again, and build up enough HCG to get a dark positive in only 10 days. 

My biggest fear is that my doctors will keep ignoring something serious and then be like ""oh oops you actually had some crazy infection in your Fallopian tubes and now you can never have children because we didn't catch it in time."" 

Is there any reason that any of you know of for my darker pregnancy tests? I'm at a loss and I think I need to know the possibilities so I can be more insistent with my doctor.",t3_hyzp21

1502,Miscarriage,"Hi, I wasn't able to edit the trigger warning to abuse specifically although I tried, so I hope I haven't triggered anyone. Please stop reading if this isn't appropriate for you.

I lost my little girl (she felt like that, anyway) at 9w. I felt like I would never get pregnant (advanced maternal age) and so although I was very sad, I was seeing the positives at the start - that I was able to conceive, next time I would be lucky, etc. 

Then I started with the constant crying, and being unable to do basic tasks. One night I had an anxiety attack in the night, being scared of the dark and unable to turn off the light. 

Around this time, I started having flashbacks to abuse I suffered as a child, with disturbing intrusive thoughts. I am finding this the worst aspect of the whole thing, because it is not related, but it is mixing up with my thoughts for my daughter and my partner. I am not able to properly grieve for her, because I am trying to deal with these other thoughts. 

Has anyone else experienced disturbing intrusive thoughts about things other than the MC, because of their MC? I feel hopeless at the moment, and like she is being sidelined because of these other thoughts, which I had pretty much under control before this point.

1507,Miscarriage,"Hi, so apparently I might have miscarried the baby at my 16th week but I didn't know when it stopped growing because I had no idea I was pregnant until I started bleeding heavily last July 1. To make the story short, I bled (which was probably natural miscarriage so to speak) for 14 days and that only stopped because my OBGYN gave me pills to stop the bleeding. 

Today I'm having cramps until this moment, actually. When I peed this morning, I am not sure if it's my period or it's part still of the miscarriage because the blood's thick dark red and I noticed there might have been mucus on it and some small clots. God, I can no longer remember if that's what period looks like.

My doc told me to observe first then we'll meet on Fri given the strict quarantine measures in our area. Now I am really anxious because I don't know what this is. I'm trying not to think about it but I can't sleep. I dunno if this is normal or if I'm still pregnant (tho all tests after the miscarriage turned out negative) or if I need some kind of operation.

1508,Miscarriage,"i had a miscarriage in october of last year, no one knows besides my fiancé. to cope the past 9 months, i would joke that i’m just not meant to be a mom, or that i actually hate kids and it’s a “good thing it happened.” my fiancé would look distraught and worried when i’d start joking about it. i told myself it’s fine, i wasn’t meant to have kids. 

I tried to push down what happened, the pain, the puking from how bad it hurt. the doctor removed the baby right there in the E.R room because of how much pain i was in, i was only a few weeks along. he left it sitting next to me, the blood clot/small thing which was supposed to be a child, right next to me in a container. he walked out of the room, and left me there with what was supposed to be my baby. it was late, he must have forgotten to take it with him or something. He told me it’s common, that something was wrong with the baby the second it was conceived and it was never meant to be alive 

 I just shoved what happened down so far i’d never remember. i tried to make jokes to cover my pain. I never talked about it to anyone else. i tried to forget, to not think of it. 

but i remembered tonight. i can’t stop remembering tonight, i’m still so broken over what happened. that i’m not good enough, my body wasn’t good enough.

Anyway, we have been busy moving out of our rental and into the new place, keeping busy with cleaning the old place and projects at the new place. I’d been nice and distracted. And then it seems like every day I see a new pregnancy announcement post on social media. I try not to be bitter and let it ruin my day but seeing the “due January 2021” hurts because that’s when I was due. I am trying to limit my social media for now. And then yesterday one of my best friends texts me and tells me she needs to tell me something she’s been nervous to tell me. I knew immediately, what else could it be? She’s 8 weeks pregnant. She says it was important to her that she told me privately and not in front of other friends which I appreciate. And I’m happy for her. But man, the pain id been distracted from is now front and center again. I didn’t let any of this show to her, of course. What makes it even harder to swallow is that she’s been forthcoming that this baby wasn’t planned and she doesn’t even want it, and she may get an abortion.

1510,Miscarriage,"Graphic description of MC warning. 

I had my first miscarriage yesterday. 

I would have been 11 weeks exactly today. I’ve been spotting for two weeks now. My first appointment with the midwife would have been tomorrow. I saw the heartbeat at 8 weeks. It must have stopped developing shortly afterwards. I thought it was a low placenta or SCH. 

The spotting became heavy bleeding last night. I called my boyfriend who left work to take me to the ER to be sure. 

They took blood, urine, and did an external and internal ultrasound. They couldn’t find a heartbeat. The baby had stopped developing around 8-9 weeks. The sac and contents hadn’t expelled yet so it was deemed an incomplete miscarriage and I was told to follow up with my regular provider. 

I went home and my boyfriend and I decided he’d finish his shift (he’s a paramedic). I spent a couple hours in the shower, hoping most would happen quickly as bleeding was picking up. I experienced a twinging feeling whenever a lot of material was coming out. Similar to birthing pains. I’m pretty sure I saw the sac and what must have been the baby, though it was very small relatively. 

Once that happened bleeding and the clots mostly tapered off. I was able to get out of shower and eat and finally pass out. 

I’m going to be calling my midwife and a follow up appointment if need be, but I think that was most of it. If not all. 

How do I know when it’s over? Did the pain subside for the most part after you passed the sac? 

I’m sure my midwife will have more answers and I can follow up with L&amp;D if need be. I’m just interested in hearing from others.

1512,Miscarriage,"I feel like I'm breaking. 

This is the first time I'm putting all of this into words. I'm sorry that it's going to be long.

I miscarried on May 9th, the day before Mother's Day. I had such a torent of emotion while I was pregnant. Initially, I was distraught because it just wasn't a good time to have a baby with the pandemic, my boyfriend changing career fields, me going back to school for another degree while working, etc. We talked briefly about termination (I feel horrible even admitting it) or adoption as my brother is infertile and wants children. However, my boyfriend told me he would support whatever decision I made and that if I chose to keep it, we would raise our baby together.

I got attached. I fell in love with my little girl. 

And then we lost her. She was just... gone. 

3:00 or 4:00 AM, the day before Mother's Day, I woke up with a horrible stabbing pains and stayed in the bathroom dealing with the blood and trauma on my own until about 7:00 AM. I couldn't bear to tell my boyfriend until around 9:00 AM.

On Mother's Day, we held a Naming Ceremony and a Rite of Passing, as my culture encourages, with elements from his culture. 

That was it. It was supposed to be over. 

I never expected the storm of emotions that followed. The confusion, the guilt, the grief, the pain. Was it my fault that we lost her? What did I do wrong? Why did it happen? Why? Why? Why?

We may never know, but my doctor strongly suspects it may have to do with complications from my epilepsy. Or that something was inherently wrong with the baby. 

Some days I feel okay, like I can start to move on. Other days, I'm overwhelmed with grief and guilt. Today, I spent hours just driving because I couldn't bear to go home. The heavy, hollow feeling in my chest felt like it was going to consume me. The amount of time I've spent crying... 

I've talked to my mom about it because she had three miscarriages, my step-mom because she had one, and my sister-in-law because she had one, but I still feel so alone. I feel like there's a rift forming between me and my friends. They're sympathetic, but none of them know what to say around me because they've never experienced such loss and they feel uncomfortable talking about it. I know it's not fair to them, but I'm pulling away. 

I can only really talk to one of my friends about it and her support has been invaluable, but the feeling of isolation is still crushing.

I also don't feel like I can talk to my boyfriend about it. I don't want to burden him with the mess of my emotions. He went through the loss of a baby four years when his ex-fiancee miscarried and I can't bare to prolong his own grief or pain. 

I'm in therapy and have been since June, but I don't feel like I'm making any progress. 

I keep seeing little girls and wondering what my little girl would have been like. Would she have been curious, inquisitive, precocious, outgoing? Would she have talkative or quiet and thoughtful? Would we have been good parents?

Was it my fault? 

I just feel so broken. I can't put the scope of my grief into words. My thoughts and emotions are churning in an overwhelming current. I don't know how to move forward and I feel so alone despite the people around me.

Is this normal? When will I be able to move on? Will I ever stop feeling so much pain?",t3_hymmmd
1513,Miscarriage,"Ive struggled with depression nearly all my life so I’m no stranger to this feeling, it’s just the context is new. I had an ectopic pregnancy last month and since losing the baby I can’t find it in myself to be sexual with my fiancé. In fact I don’t really feel much anything for him lately. Or anyone else really. Even my dogs are just there without any emotional attachment. 

I miss my baby. I want them back.

(And before I get spammed with all the “your life has meaning” “don’t give up”. I’ve struggled with depression since birth, giving up isn’t in my nature so calm down. For those wanting me to seek help I’ve lost my heath insurance due to covid so that’s not happening either, besides meds take away my creativity and the business I opened to focus on anything other than the loss of my baby requires me to be creative.)

Anyways my fiancé keeps trying to make moves and I just can’t find anything in me to reciprocate. Use to be the two of us were bunnies. It hurts me seeing him wanting me like this and me just unable to and I just wish he’d understand where I am. He says he understands but then a couple days later he’ll try again.

1514,Miscarriage,"I had my miscarriage now coming up to 5 weeks.  I’m pretty confident last weds I ovulated for the first time since as I was using Clearblue adv and temping. 

My question is this is my first luteal phase since my mc and I wondered if any of you had similar symptoms to when you were pregnant (without actually being pregnant) during that first time?

For example when pregnant I had sore boobs, nausea and I was quite sensitive (down there) and had slight cramping every now and then. Also after BD (didn’t have this last week or the week before). Anyway it’s come back.. but then again I also don’t know if this is psychological as I’m only 5 dpo but since I might have very low amounts of hcg in my system still (getting still very very faint positive on first response and negative on cheapies) maybe if I was pregnant again this soon I would feel the symptoms quicker.

1516,Miscarriage,"I'm going through my second miscarriage. My first one was only a few months ago. We started trying two years ago and have been through some treatment with no success. These babies were conceived naturally, which was amazing. I am hopeful that we'll get pregnant again soon.

However, it's still heartbreaking. I told some of my family members via messages that I'd passed the baby the night before. I also told them about how difficult it was to get a diagnosis that the baby was dead. After a couple of thoughtful messages and questions, they changed the subject to ""happier"" things: what they've been up to that morning, suggesting nice things for us to do with another relative... 

I know they don't mean any harm, but I feel like they're not getting it. Nobody gets that I have only just flushed our baby down the toilet. It's hard for anyone else to grasp what it feels like, unless they've experienced similar. I don't feel like talking about anything else in that same conversation, I don't want to change the subject, I don't want to hear about other family's happy times, let alone see photos of them. Am I being silly? Isn't this the kind of situation where I can expect a conversation to be all about my traumatizing experience?",t3_hy23g2
1517,Miscarriage,How long is a natural MC supposed to last.. it’s been a week now since I passed and I still have a sharp consistent pain to the right of my uterus. The doctor put me on antibiotics and said everything was cleared out but I’m really tired of wearing a pad and hurting. I know everyone’s experience is different but can someone tell me how long it takes.,t3_hyaw8k
1518,Miscarriage,"Long post 
I wish there were kinder ways to label these situations. I’m supposed to be 12 weeks pregnant. 2 weeks ago there was very light brown spotting. Panicked, I called my dr and the nurse told me it was normal as long as there was no cramping or fever. I hung up but the paranoia was still there. I still had pregnancy symptoms - fatigue, swelling, food aversions - and I kept telling myself not to stress. 

Last Sunday, the day before my 11 week ultrasound, there was still spotting. I decided around 11 that night I just couldn’t wait for my 8 am appointment. So we drove to the ER. Up to that point I was fine but when the front desk told me my boyfriend couldn’t come in and I’d need to go alone, I couldn’t keep it together. The nurse asked why I was there and before I could think I cried out, “I’m miscarrying. I need help”. They let my boyfriend sit with me. The nurse on call checked me in. She then proceeded to make me feel like an idiot for crying. “Only 1 in 4 pregnancies end in miscarriage. You are probably getting worked up over nothing “ we sat. For hours. An ultrasound tech came to grab me finally and I had to go in alone. She tried, for what seemed like hours to move the wand around my stomach looking for a baby. Clicking the keyboard. Taking measurements. I tried to scan her face for a hint of what was happening. She said then I needed to do a interior ultrasound. Even still while she shoved that inside my uterus and moved it all around, I couldn’t tell if the baby was okay. When she finished I asked if it was alive. She looked and said she couldn’t tell me. Legally she wasn’t allowed and I would have to wait. Wait. The thing I’d been doing for 3 hours already. 

Eventually they put me in a room. Nurses came in and out. Connected me to machines. Poked and prodded. All the while I’m having to text my bf what’s happening. The nurse couldn’t find a vain so he had to keep sticking the needle in and out and swirl it around under my skin. Finally, a good vain. By 3:30 am the dr came in and performed a physical exam. She came back in with my results. She said the baby was measuring only 7.5 weeks but there was a heartbeat. I felt relieved. At least it was still alive. A few hours later I went to my OB. I told that ultrasound tech I’d been in the ER and showed her my paperwork. She performed an ultrasound. Took measurements. Then she did a transvaginal ultrasound. No heartbeat. She said the baby was only 8+3 and likely died shortly after my first appointment. She didn’t know why the ER said there was a live baby.  I laid there and cried. When I pulled it together to get off the table, I looked and the table where I laid was now covered in blood. I lost it. I got dressed and was escorted to the dr.’s office. I was in a dazed state. I felt like a Charlie Brown character where everyone around you talks and all you hear is a trombone. She said I could let the fetus pass naturally or take a medication to force it out or even have a D&amp;C. Having to choose the best way to get a dead baby out of your body is not a discussion I thought I’d be having. 

Two days later contractions started at 7am. Two hours writhing in pain on the toilet and it came out. Just like that all that was hoped and dreamed for was just a mass of blood and tissue in a toilet. I felt tired and sore. 

It’s three days since then. I’m still cramping and spotting. The swelling in my face and feet is gone. Cravings disappeared. Feeling like an empty failed shell.",t3_hxx5za

Just for reference I had the initial D&amp;C 7 weeks ago and then had to go back into hospital due to cramping, to find out there was still some placenta left in my uterus and my cervix had closed so they had to go back in.

So excited, scared and over joyed with having a baby. We soon found out a few others were pregnant around the same time but one close couple was 4 days ahead of us. We were so excited to be pregnant so close and we loved connecting about it. I found out at 13 weeks on April 1st (my mother birthday as well as April fools) that the baby’s heartbeat stopped at 8 weeks. Due to Covid everything was so prolonged but I finally got a D&amp;c at 16 weeks. During that time I saw people announcing everything and I had to sit there knowing that my baby has passed away and I’m still pregnant with a non viable baby. Never got to announce her to everyone, never got to announce her gender and never got to feel her move. I see people announcing pregnancies left and right and for the most part I’m really good with it and truly happy. The one close friend has a beautiful bump a great pregnancy with zero complications and she’s 30 weeks now. I should be there with her. I got invited to her baby shower next month and I just stared at the invite. It hurts so bad knowing everything she’s going through I should be right there with our healthy baby.

They gave me nothing and said to follow up with ob Monday.  Well I would have went to the OB but as of 7/19 I'm still positive for covid. No ob office will see me.

1525,Miscarriage,"It’s been 3 and a half weeks since I found out I lost my baby. 4 and a half weeks since I found out something may be wrong. I’m supposed to be almost 12 weeks pregnant, almost out of the first trimester. I’m supposed to be planning pregnancy announcements, like those first ones I looked at. The cute “mommy and daddy didn’t social distance” ones. I’m supposed to be stressing about telling my new boss. I’m supposed to be so close to finding out the gender. But instead I’m here. 

Things have gotten easier than the first day or the first couple weeks. I’ve gone entire days without crying. I’ve set up the house I just moved into and I returned to work. I’m trying to get excited about my new teaching job in the fall. 

But then I have days like today. Days where all I can think about was when I was pregnant. Days where I feel so fucking guilty for crying the first couple days I found out I was pregnant, when I was excited but also selfishly upset about all the changes I’d need to make. What I wouldn’t give to be pregnant again. Days where I feel so naive for going into that ultrasound room, a smile on my face, expecting to get a picture of our baby to bring home to my boyfriend. How does that feel like a lifetime ago? Days where I want to smack myself in the face for telling so many people, who now have to mourn our loss as well. Days where I can’t stop thinking about my super pregnant obgyn telling me, in a room with baby pictures and labor pictures all over the wall, that my baby had stopped growing at 5.5 weeks. Days where I’m okay when I’m next to someone, but the second I’m alone I’m sobbing uncontrollably. Days where I wonder if the bad things I’ve done in the past/bad karma is the reason this happened to me. Days where I curse god or whoever because everywhere I see around me there’s kids and there’s babies, and even that horrible girl from high school who keeps having her kids taken away, even that young girl from the school I worked at last year, even women strung out on drugs who’ve delivered healthy babies, and yet I couldn’t even grow mine past 5 and a half weeks, and my stupid body couldn’t even realize it.

1528,Miscarriage,"I had a D&amp;C 2.5 weeks ago after a MMC at 9 weeks. The procedure itself was quick and painless. But I've been bleeding non-stop ever since. It's not bad, I can manage with 3 pantyliners a day, and it's all brown so presumably old blood. But what worries me is it shows absolutely sign of improvement. It just keeps going as if it's not planning to ever stop. It's beginning to remind me of my previous MMC (when I got miso instead of a D&amp;C and after weeks and weeks of incessant bleeding it turned out I had a small amount of retained tissue after all). It's frustrating I still can't have a bath or have sex, and the pads are really starting to irritate my skin. 

When I asked what to expect, the nurse told me anything up to six(!) weeks of bleeding is still perfectly normal. I couldn't help but think she said that because basically they have no idea about numbers and stats and don't want me to call in every other day because it still hasn't stopped. I find it immensely frustrating to have to deal with this again and, like last time, have no idea what is normal and what isn't. I have no follow-up appointment so it's really up to me to be assertive and get a check-up scheduled if I think I need one. But how long do I wait?

1529,Miscarriage,"I had a missed miscarriage a month ago.  I ended up miscarrying naturally that night on the day I found out.  I took the last month off work to process it emotionally and physically.  My coworker (we will call her A) who I consider my closest friend at work knew about it and had been checking in on me occasionally.

Well, today was my first day back at work.  Before 8 am, she decided to announce to me that she’s 7 weeks pregnant, giggling.  My friend sat there with my other coworker (we will call her B) talking about it and asking me how I was.  I couldn’t even begin to talk.  It’s almost like I began to have tunnel vision.  I sat staring at my computer while they talked to each other (B is 6 months pregnant as well).  

Finally, when A got up to go do something, B asked me if I was okay.  I said no and proceeded to cry.  

I want to also preface this by saying A is with a man who she has been with for going on two years.  They have had loads of issues and SHE WAS SLEEPING IN THE OTHER ROOM for a month back in May to June. He is a bartender and works until 3 am.  He has a drinking problem and comes home black out drunk almost every night.  WHAT THE ACTUAL F*CK.  

I don’t know.  
I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.  I have been silent around her and short with her all day because I have no words.  Why did you have to tell me?

1530,Miscarriage,"Alternate account and details changed to for anonymity.  CW: suicidal ideation.

Five years ago today, I delivered a girl who died in utero at 20 weeks gestation—technically a missed miscarriage but it felt like a stillbirth. I drove myself to the doctor, found out alone, and had to wait thirty minutes for my partner to arrive at the doctor. Due to some horrible treatment to the doctor on call that evening, I had PTSD and awful PPD that almost swallowed me whole. It’s taken years, but I’m doing much, much better mentally.

Since that moment, my sex drive has been basically non-existent. We have sex about once a week because if there is any more time between my husband acts like an asshole and is rude and short with people—I know I don’t have to, I would just rather not deal with the pissy attitude. I’ve spoken with my OBGYN and gotten some medication that may help, some of which required being taken to a compounding pharmacy about half an hour away because my doctor said this place does the best formulation. My husband took the medication this morning but the pharmacist said the way my doctor told me to make sure it was filled they couldn’t do because it wasn’t written on the script. They could either fill it as written or wait until Monday to speak to my doctor. I told my husband to just tell them to wait until they heard from the doctor.

I get a call later and the script is filled—I thought they heard from the doctor. Once the medication gets home, my husband tells me they couldn’t get in touch with the doctor so he just picked up what they could fill. Even though I said not to. 

This sounds petty, I know. Thing is, it caused me to remember something that happened 5 years ago on the worst day of my life. My doctor said I should be checked into the hospital so I could be induced and deliver the baby’s remains. She said I could either be checked in that afternoon or wait until the morning. I was about to say I wanted to wait until the morning, but my husband spoke up and said I should be admitted that afternoon. I was far too numb to contradict him. Because I was induced that evening, I got horrible care and got PTSD. I came within a hair of suicide due to my mental state afterwards.

I feel like my husband doesn’t respect my bodily autonomy, but I can’t tell if I’m overreacting due to the extreme emotions connected to this day. If anyone could help me sort through these thoughts, I would be appreciative.",t3_hxfi1f

He sent me for blood work today and for Monday to check my levels. He doesn’t want to rule anything out until he sees #’s. Could it be tubal? Doubtful. I wish he just came out and told me it is over...instead I am hanging on by lab results.

When I started bleeding I still had to work, I didn’t get ONE day off to process and heal from this traumatic experience, i  only got a few hours off to go to the doctor to confirm. I was still expected to work even though I was losing my baby. I told my coworkers what was going on so they would know why I was off. I have good days and bad days, but lately I have a so many bad days because I can’t keep pushing this to the back of my head. Because I’ve been having bad days, the people around me keep asking me what’s wrong. Like I know they can’t read my mind but I told them what happened, is it not obvious that I’m still grieving?

I’m disappearing. Slowly I’m disintegrating. 
I lost a child. She might not seem like a child to most but she was my child. I carried her, I loved her. She was meant to be safe with me, she was meant to be protected from the world for 9 months in my body. My body killed her, my body rejected her and and my body let me down. 
They keep saying “this is isn’t something you caused, this isn’t something you did wrong”. I felt it in me the whole time, I believe that’s what caused it. Manifesting her dying on accident because I was so afraid of losing her. 
She’s gone now, they scraped the last pieces of her out and I’m empty again.  
Her name was Ava. 
Ava meaning life. 
My little Ava, she was going to be a perfect little sister for Sophia. She was going to be her best friend, just like I had a best friend growing up. I lost mine and Sophia lost hers and she doesn’t even know it. 
I’m so jealous that she doesn’t know, that she doesn’t understand what we’ve lost. 
How am I meant to just keep going? How am I meant to move on and say, it wasn’t a child. It was just a fetus.

People who I didn’t even know really cared have been sending me care packages, dropping by to make sure I’m ok, and sending me encouraging words.

1538,Miscarriage,"I apologize in advance for the length. So much of this already difficult experience was made more frustrating for me by health staff. 

I went in for my dating ultrasound two days ago (by my tracking I was 7w1d) and there was no heartbeat. I had a previous pregnancy where the heartbeat and movement was visible at this same time so I knew something was wrong just by looking. I could tell the tech was very experienced so as she told me with hidden tears in her eyes that she was going to call my doctor, send her the report and I should expect a call back, I should have known 100%. But there was still that little bit of hope that maybe my dates were just off, because no one had told me a definite ""you're baby is gone"". They just sent me on my way. Either way, I should know in a few hours at most, right? 

Nope. The rest of the day goes by and no call. I figured, okay the doc didn't get to it today but I'll def get a call first thing in the morning. Nothing. I waited an hour past opening to call the office and ask what's going on, when can I expect a call. They acted like this was the first time seeing my file. So I called the hospital I had the ultrasound at. The tech told me my doctor is apparently out of town but she spoke to a nurse yesterday and they should have the report. So I call the office back and demand to speak to someone now. The nurse told me that they just got the report this morning and the doctor filling in hasn't been able to look yet but she will call me when she does. Hours go by. I've already had a panic attack at work because of the unknown. I call the office again. The doctor still hasn't looked. More hours go by, the office is about to close. So I call again because I really don't think I'll make it through the night without knowing. By now, the lady answering the phone knows me by name and she even feels bad, so she puts me on hold while she tries to find someone to talk to me. Even she couldn't find someone but she took my number to call me back when she did. By this point, I have gone through an entire day of work, I'm in the car on my way home, and finally I get a call telling me the doctor is going to look now and I can expect a call within 45 minutes. Oh good, more waiting. An hour goes by, I finally get a call from the office. It's not even the doctor. It's a nurse, reading the doctor's notes, to tell me that ""yep, it's a missed abortion. You can come in at the next availability (which isn't even until Monday?!) to discuss with your doctor where to go from here, whether it be naturally or D&amp;C"". They're not even sending me for bloodwork or a confirmatory ultrasound? I asked how can they tell just from a report? Since it wasn't even the doctor I was talking to, the nurse told me that from the doctor's notes it looks like the gestational sac is misshapen, the yolk sac is too big, and combined with no cardiac activity it is most definitely a nonviable, unhealthy pregnancy. 

I didn't even cry when the nurse told me this, because I had just gone through an emotionally exhausting, stressful day of waiting and I was just so angry at this point. Now, I just feel numb. I think I already knew deep down, but I am so disappointed in the care, or lack thereof, I received. Is this normal to not even follow up with any testing? To not even speak to a doctor when being told your baby is gone? I feel as if this traumatic, major life event for me was put on the back burner and saved for the last thing before they go out the door. I feel like I was shown no empathy or sensitivity.

1539,Miscarriage,"Take me back to the moment we learned of your existence.


You appeared in the form of two pink lines.

The first thing I worried about was failing you.

What mistakes would I make? Am I enough?

As the weeks progressed and my mind eased, 

Those worries began to dwindle...

All I could feel was a euphoria of warmth in my heart. 

Entirely devoured by constant daydreaming...

Your name.

Smile. 

Laugh.

Cry.

First words.

Wondering the person you'd become.

Would you shout at us or react defiantly in your teenage years?

Anticipating you'd feel comfortable telling us secrets.

Learning from my parents mistakes and inaccuracies.

Holding tight to their positive traits and qualities.


I visualized what a great dad you'd have. 

Cherishing how much he loved you in just a few weeks.

Would you be a boy that he'd shape into a kind young man? Would you be a girl that he'd treat delicately, but raise to be strong and confident? 

No matter, he would've adored and protected you all the same.

I thought of future family events.

All the cousins you'd have, so excited to meet you.

The goofy uncle's that would make you laugh.

Your grandmothers pure joy.

Having a grandpa to take you on fishing trips and spoil you.

Your great grandmothers undying love. 


So many plans were made for you in just eleven weeks. 

But eleven days ago it was violently ripped away from us.

The bright, colorful, beautiful cheerfulness and aspirations we shared for you, in the matter of an instant; faded to black - torn to shreds. 


My soul feels like it's been sucked out of my chest.

Not a thing makes sense anymore.

I cannot sleep, because I'm thinking of you...

Crying and yearning for you to return to us, where you belong. 

When I eventually fall asleep because my body says enough,

I awake with pure emptiness. 

Feeling weighed down by this sorrow.

Getting out of bed feels pointless.


Whenever I go through something difficult in life and it seems as though it's not fair... My brain is conditioned to put myself in others shoes. Cliché, but ""it could always be worse"", I'm a firm believer in this. Stories that I've heard of others, run through my mind and I'm reminded, no matter the situation, this is temporary and in the grand scheme of things in life, usually means nothing.

But with that being said, I can't help but feel that after what happened last year... This just didn't seem deserved. It feels like a cruel joke. 

Those 17 hellish days in ICU, taught me one thing...

You can make all the plans you want in life, but nothing is promised. That doesn't mean to put life on hold and live in fear, but try to feel your feet on the ground each day. Smell the air. Stop and watch a sunset. Tell the ones you love how much they matter to you. Live in the moment and not worry so much about the little things that don't always go as planned. 

See the bigger picture. 


And this is what I've had to endure once again with your loss. 

We made all these plans, just to have them stolen. 

Making it all seem like it was for nothing.

That can't be it...


You were only here with us for 11 weeks, 

but you will live in our hearts for the rest of our lives. 

I pray you felt all the love I had for you in this body we shared.

You brought us so much happiness and taught me more than I could've ever imagined in this short time. 

We are forever thankful for you,

we will always love you 

and we will never forget you.",t3_hwb5hp

Yesterday (Wednesday) I started what I think is my period? Bleeding is consistent with what my period looks like.

1541,Miscarriage,"I just got the call that my HCG levels decreased over my 48 hour draw at 5 weeks. I had a feeling from the beginning that this wouldn't work, and my FRERs have looked the same for about a week, but it's still hitting hard. I guess I'm just feeling flustered and anxious. How long did it take you to miscarry after you knew it wasn't viable? Did you need medical intervention to start the process?",t3_hwi04t
1542,Miscarriage,"Hi. My name is Sara, and I miscarried during quarantine.

I had a second trimester miscarriage, at 18 weeks, and I had to go through everything that followed completely. alone.

From laying back on the bed, and hearing the ultrasound tech say “I’m so sorry, but I’m not finding a fetal heartbeat” to walking into the hospital 2 days later, and the appointments in between, I did all of it all. By. Myself. I did not have my husband holding my hand, or helping me stand when I was crying so hard that I thought my knees might buckle at any moment. I did not have him sitting in the chair next to my hospital bed as I got my iv inserted, or when I was crying so hard that I was throwing up, or when I was waking up from anesthesia. He wasn’t there at all, because he wasn’t allowed to be. Because somewhere, someone up the food chain, decided that mothers that were having miscarried babies surgically removed, were not allowed support partners. 

Just let that sink in for a moment.

Mothers
that were having miscarried babies surgically removed, 
were not 
allowed 
support partners. 

A couple of weeks ago, before my world completely shattered, my heart was absolutely breaking for the mothers in New York State that were being forced to give birth alone. Women that had endured give or take 40 weeks of pregnancy, with their partners beside them, had to walk into those hospitals and go through the hardest thing a womans body can go through, completely. alone. My heart also broke for the partners of these women, who had watched them and cared for them through 40ish weeks of pregnancy, only to have to watch them as they walked away through those hospital doors without being able to be there for them. Without being able to watch their child enter the world. 

And then, the outcry of support for these women was absolutely incredible. The support was so magnificent, that policies were changed. Women no longer had to go through birth alone. 

And then! Just a few short weeks later, There I was. Walking into the hospital alone. My husband watching me walk away, through those hospital doors. Alone. By. Myself.
Why did I have to do this alone, because my baby wasn’t alive? Because I wasn’t giving birth to a full term, live baby? Because I wasn’t giving birth, because I had chosen a D&amp;E over induction and birth? Who made that fucking rule? Who signed that policy?

I know that the majority of people right now are all doing the best we can, figuring out how to navigate living through this virus, but for misscarrying mothers- we need to do BETTER.

I am heart broken. I am completely shattered. We lost our daughter, and our world has lost all of its color. 
But on top of that? 
I am ANGRY. I am angry at the system and I am angry that so many mothers have felt so incredible alone in these last two months. 
Not just alone like they’re stuck in their house quarantining and they’re bored. No. Not that kind of alone. I am talking about feeling Empty. in the truest sense of the word. Like the earth was ripped out from beneath their feet, and they are free falling into darkness, never to touch solid ground again.


My hope in sharing this today, is that we start talking about this. We start the conversation about mothers misscarrying during quarantine. And if I can help even one other woman feel the slightest bit less alone, I will be ecstatic. Because I absolutely, 10,000% guarantee that I am not the only woman to feel like I am falling into the endless darkness in these last couple months. And that is NOT okay. 
It is inhumane to make a human being go through what I went through ALONE. And I KNOW I am not the only one.


We need to show support.
We need to advocate for these women.
But most of all? 
       we NEED to do BETTER.",t3_hw46uq

1544,Miscarriage,"EDIT: got my results from yesterday and it was down to 12.5 so everything seems to be good. Thanks for all your replies!!

I had my blood drawn 07/06 after cramping and bleeding (I was about 5 weeks pregnant at this point) my HCG was at a 45. A week later I get my levels drawn again they are at a 36. My last drawing on 06/15 put my levels at 55. I go back in today for more blood drawn, I’m just trying to prepare myself. I’m positive it was a miscarriage because of the amount of bleeding (i bled from 07/06 u til 07/22). Is this a potential ectopic pregnancy? I haven’t had any cramps or pain besides the initial on 07/06.",t3_hwi674
1545,Miscarriage,"I was 10 weeks pregnant for the first scan and the tech saw immediately my pregnancy was anembryonic. I was shocked, but also in the days right before the scan my nausea and pregnancy symptoms had started to subside so part of me felt like I knew. My husband was in the car because he couldn’t come in (COVID) and I just started crying very hard while the sonographer was still conducting the exam. I was so, so sad, angry and profoundly disappointed. I opted for a D&amp;C and had a strange experience that I’ve only been able to find a little bit about online - the doctor wasn’t able to get everything and said it was like some of it was stuck to the inside of my uterus. It took about a week for my body to do it naturally and this was a painful process, emotionally and physically. Because the doctor suspected maybe lack of blood flow had caused it to be stuck, he had the material tested for chromosome abnormality so we could determine whether it was a “typical” anembryonic miscarriage (missing or extra chromosomes) or something is wrong with my uterus. The test results showed the embryo was normal, meaning my body just couldn’t do it. I don’t know what to do with this information. I feel like when people talk about how common miscarriage is, they aren’t talking about what happened to me. I am so confused about how to process this information and feel like I’ve lost so much hope for my future. I want to start planning a life without a child that I give birth to, but I don’t want to avoid the grief I feel or distract myself from how I really feel, which is immensely sad. I know doing those things will just drag out the pain. Anyway, I don’t feel like I can really talk about this with anyone in my life except my husband and he is very supportive, but he is sad too, and I feel like he doesn’t know what to say to me other than what I’m feeling is okay. Thanks for being here and letting me vent about this. If anyone has had a similar experience and wants to talk about it I’m open to that.",t3_hwatns
1546,Miscarriage,"I don't even know where to start. My wife and I are both healthy, both 30, both wanting children. Seriously started trying about 4 months ago. With the biggest shit eating grin on her face she handed me a father's day card from our dog. A tradition she's been doing since we adopted our pup. ""Hope you've had fun practicing with me, cause you're about to graduate...."" I started crying tears of joy. I was happy for us, but really happy for her. She wanted this so bad. 

Wednesday of last week she had some spotting, did a blood draw to test HCG. Friday they retested. Numbers did not climb like they should have. So she went into the ER and got a ultrasound. Our little peanut was pumping along at 129bpm. It was surreal. I could watch her anxiety wash away. 

Today we went back for another ultrasound with our OBGYN just to double check everything. They looked, and looked, but no heart beat. I couldn't believe life was just gone like that. They offered explanations of that nothing we did wrong, sometimes things just happen. 

I held all my tears in at the office to be strong for my wife, but lost it as soon as I sat in the car. It was heart wrenching. 

**Now the question - what can/should I do as a husband to comfort and care for her? I'm at a loss of words of what to do. Any advice for what your spouse did for you, or wish they would have done? Or other spouses supporting a pregnant spouse who miscarried, what did you do?** 

I bought flowers, favorite junk food, chocolate, and ice cream. But I just want to rip all of her pain away and do something for her. I am just so lost...",t3_hw4imv
1547,Miscarriage,"Had a private scan at 8w1d and baby was fine with strong heartbeat. Felt something was off (intuition nothing else) and had another private scan at exactly 10w to find the baby had passed at 9w. Because of covid, I’ve been told to just wait it out by the nhs and let nature take its course. I wasn’t offered a confirmation scan or pills and my county is straight up not offering any surgical intervention.

It is now 16 days since my baby would have passed and I have only had very minimal bleeding and passed a small clot. The bleeding has slowed down to minimal brown spotting but I can’t believe that this is it. Should I not have had a lot of blood, been in pain and passed some major clots for being 9 weeks? I’m so confused and not sure what to do? Can anyone else chime in with their experiences as to what is normal and what is not?",t3_hw3rhi
1548,Miscarriage,I’ve been taking it daily during pregnancy and prior due to a blood clotting disorder (hetero for factor v leiden). Will it help or hurt if I continue it during my impending miscarriage? I’m waiting a week to see if I pass naturally and then doing a d&amp;c if not. I assume I should stop aspirin a few days before d&amp;c? Ugh. Need to call doc tomorrow but wondering if anyone here knows anything! Thank you.,t3_hwajw4
1549,Miscarriage,"I had a medical miscarriage with misoprostol on June 7. I bled for almost 3 weeks (1 normal bleeding and the other 2 weeks just spotting).

Low back pain is back. My HCG levels are down to 4 already and my home ovulation strips are negative. What is going on???

I have an ultrasound booked for next week. Anyone have experienced anything similar? I'm just tired of this. Can't believe this is taking so long.

1550,Miscarriage,"I have always kept a journal, but yesterday I started a new section just for processing my MC. I have been anxious to get back to TTC but we can't start having sex until Friday. My pregnancy tests are still coming back positive, so I don't even know when I'll ovulate. It's all been a lot to deal with.

So I now take my morning pregnancy test, tape it in my journal and write down where I'm at emotionally and physically. I write down all the crazy stuff I've been googling. I write down how long until we can have sex again. I document my CM or any weird symptoms.

1552,Miscarriage,"Today was my D&amp;C after my first miscarriage. I was a bundle of nerves leading up to when they wheeled me back and then all of a sudden I was sobbing in the OR with a half dozen strangers doing different things to get me ready. It was easily one of the worst moments of my life. I didn’t even know there were still tears left to cry. But there I was ugly crying and gasping as they tried to put the oxygen mask on me. There was the sweetest nurse who dried my tears and stroked my arm. She was a godsend. And the anesthesiologist took over when the nurse had to step out. They really were the kindest staff. Luckily I went under quickly but then I woke up in recovery still crying. I just couldn’t stop the tears flowing down my face. I hope now that the waiting is over and the D&amp;C is done I can start to heal. It’s amazing how suddenly these feeling hit sometime. Sending love to you all ❤️

1553,Miscarriage,"I am 8 weeks, yesterday I had some spotting all day but didn't find need to be concerned, this morning I woke up and had some bleeding that has gotten heavier throughout the day. Called the Dr went in for an appointment and they gave me blood work and a physical exam, based on the exam, the bleeding and the intense cramping and back pain I've been experiencing the Dr called it ""an early 1st trimester loss"" and told me the cramping an pain will get worse, I am scheduled to go back next week for a sonogram. 

Here's my question, they did not give me a sonogram today (short on sonographers and busy) so do I take what the Dr said as a confirmation that I am indeed experiencing a miscarriage? Has anyone else had a similar experience with their Dr?",t3_hw3l7b
1554,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone. Found out on Monday that I’m having a miscarriage. I had my first scan at 7w3d where everything was normal, with a strong heartbeat. A few days later I noticed some light brown spotting. The doctor’s office didn’t think it was a big deal, but I went in at 8w2d just to be safe. The scan looked good, and I again heard the heartbeat. The doctor did a pelvic exam and said my cervix looked “beautiful”. Two days later, my husband and I drove a few states away for a getaway in a cabin in the woods. The spotting turned red and got heavier, so on Monday we went to the local tiny hospital. They did an ultrasound and bloodwork and confirmed “fetal demise” (ugh, what a term). So somewhere between Friday and Monday, the heartbeat stopped. They also found two embryos...and the past scans had only shown one. 

They let me go home, and I’m hoping I can do this on my own. I *hate* hospitals and doctors offices, and have a history of sexual assault/trauma that makes pelvic exams or procedures really challenging for me. I’ve been bleeding pretty heavily for two days now, but haven’t passed any big clots or tissue. Not really sure what to expect, or how long it will take. 

I’m feeling kind of numb right now; I know my way of coping with things is usually to shut off my feelings and go into “solutions mode” but I’m trying to listen to my body and take care of myself. I’m sorry that this subreddit even has to exist, but thankful for a community of folks who have been through this before and can offer each other support.",t3_hvvibs

1557,Miscarriage,"This is my first reddit post &amp; I truly hate it is because of this. I tested positive at home on June 7 and was so excited. I already have other children and weren’t going to tell them until later because I’ve had two other miscarriages as well. This Friday I started spotting and went to the er. I was told I wasn’t as far along based off of my last period, I should have been 11 weeks but I was showing about 8 weeks and there was a heartbeat. I was in a lot of pain so they gave me morphine through the iv, after assuring me it was safe for the baby and sent me hone to follow up with my dr Monday.
Over the weekend my bleeding slowly got heavier. I tried to make my appointment Monday and was told I couldn’t be seen until Wednesday and to just go to the er again.. 
I went to the closest one and they verified I was miscarrying. Because of Covid I had to hear this completely alone. (Don’t get me wrong I fully understand the precautions) Ever since getting it verified my heart is completely broken. My husband ended up telling everyone I was pregnant despite me wanting him to so my children were incredibly excited. All my four year old daughter talked about was how she was going to be a big sister and help take care of the baby. I had to explain to her that the baby just didn’t grow. I’m not in a mentally stable place to even begin trying to explain death and the questions after. 
I feel completely broken... like my soul has just been ripped apart. I’m doing my best to hold it together around my kids but alone all I can do is sob. I woke myself up crying this morning. I know all of this is normal &amp; I don’t feel like harming myself or anything like that. I just can’t understand why...

I mean I shouldn’t even be having a period.. But I didn’t get any pms symptoms and instead my symptoms are more like a miscarriage. But then I talked myself out of that and thought maybe it’s just a random period. But then I changed my tampon and when I pulled it out there was grayish/pinkish tissue that came out with it and it was relatively big. It’s not a clot it’s actual tissue...

Said when I'm ready that I can start trying again. That if my body's ready it will get pregnant. No reason to wait. I told her I may look into a therapist and she praised me that I can see myself struggling with this still.  She asked how I felt emotionally first. Then physically.  She did a quick exam and I told her sometimes during sex it does hurt and when she pushed in a few places I had discomfort. She didn't seem to alarmed.  Guess I'll go back to my LH which still seems thrown off by my HCG that is apparently undetectable in the office.  No follow up HCG blood work or ultrasound was needed.  Said she would see me again when I'm pregnant!  I thought today's appointment would be harder on me but it wasn't. I was sad and I felt envy of the pregant lady in the waiting room.

1565,Miscarriage,"Hi there. I'm so happy that I found this subreddit and know that it's not just my wife and I who going through this experience. We found out last week, at the 10w mark, that there was no heartbeat...

So I've been reading as many articles as I possibly can to understand more and see how I can help my wife. But the thing is, every article mentions communicating about it, talking about it, crying (together and alone) about it, but my wife seems to have no interest in any of that. She cried a little on the day we were notified, and that evening when she wrote about it in her journal. But since then, nothing. She's made it clear that she wants no special treatment (for example, my sister and her husband wanted to make something and bring it over, chat on the phone to express support, etc.).

Is this one of those things that everyone processes differently? She's never been one to talk through things (part of this is cultural - she's Japanese, and part is from her family situation when she grew up). I just feel like I keep seeing this need to communicate when I look at articles online, but she is clearly uninterested (trust me, I've tried...it only leads to fights). Now I'm just trying to be around and ready, but treat her the same way she is treating the situation - by largely pretending things are as normal.

To be honest, I want a hug and to talk about it too, so maybe I'm being a little selfish here...Anyways, I wanted some thoughts from others who are going through/have gone through this experience and make sure I'm doing the right thing. Thank you.",t3_hvldo0

I'm having a silent miscarriage. And my OB said at 6w + a few days, it may not be of adequate enough size to properly test. She was vague about out-of-pocket pricing, saying several thousand dollars - which for me is OK if it provides answers.

1571,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone. Really sad to be in this hell club, but it was very helpful to me to read people's experiences here when I was getting ready to start my medicated MC, so I'd like to pay it forward by telling my story.

I found out at my second ultrasound at 12 weeks that baby only made it 1 week past our last ultrasound at 8 weeks. So that means baby was measuring 9 weeks at our 12 week appointment, and no heartbeat was seen. As soon as the tech confirmed it out loud, I sort of went somewhere else. Fortunately my husband was with me, and they let us scream and wail together in the room alone for some time (I have no idea how long it was). They counseled us that we had three options: wait for my body to eject the pregnancy naturally (they'd let me wait up to 4 weeks), take some medication to help me pass it immediately, or have a d&amp;c.

I chose the medication. They told me they would give me one dose of misoprostol, and if it didn't work they would fill another for me. They told me how to take it, took blood for an hCG test, and we went home. We spent the rest of the day at my mother's house resting and being comforted and calling our other family to tell them what happened.

My husband did some internet research to figure out how to best prepare. He found some great lists of things to have to prepare and ways to grieve and practical tips on how to make it happen. He's the best. I felt so wonderfully supported by him learning how to spell the medication I was taking and finding other experiences online to learn what I might be in for. I can't find the list of preparations he liked the best, but it included things like: a colander to collect remains if that's your plan, a pair of scissors in case you need to cut a cord, some absorbant pads (they're designed for incontinence) for near the toilet and under your sheets if you're concerned about bleeding, or want to stop and pass somewhere along the floor, snacks and drinks to have in bed, really immersive entertainment. This is a great way for fathers to stay involved in a really horrible time.

We picked up all our supplies and my medication the following morning, and we did a bunch of research about experiences for the afternoon. I started my meds in the evening.

Took 4 tabs of misoprostol vaginally at 9:15pm on a Thursday.

Intense shivering around 9:40pm.

Temperature began increasing. Took 2 ibuprofen. Temp peaked at 101.4 deg F at 11:15pm.

Had a few instances of moderately severe diarrhea, each with light spotting that I mistook as the beginning of bleeding. I had no continuous bleeding at all.

Bad contractions started around 4am. They got stronger and closer together until they were 3-5 minutes apart around 8-9am. They went on, getting a little weaker and farther apart, until about 1pm Friday. This is when I finally got a nurse from my OB practice on the phone. I was prescribed another dose of misoprostol. I also asked for painkillers. I strongly recommend the painkillers. I was prescribed tramadol.

I rested for Friday night and took my second dose at 9:30am on Saturday morning. Another 4 tabs, vaginally.

Cramping got intense again around 10:40am.

I took 1 tramadol at noon. This is the only tramadol I took.

Started continuous bleeding at 4:10pm.

I passed a large mass (\~1.5 inch sphere) at 10pm Saturday night.

Saturated a maxi pad between 10pm and 11:15. Was watching closely for excessive bleeding.

Heavy bleeding until 1am, but didn't saturate any more pads.

Changed pad at 5am.

Changed pad at 9:30 am. Took a shower. Passed a stringy mass, about 2 inches long.

Changed pad at 12:15 pm Sunday. Passed a mass about 1.5-2x larger than the first mass, oblong in shape.

Bleeding got much lighter after this. Medium period level bleeding for the rest of Sunday, light bleeding on Monday.

Final thoughts: I was terrified of taking the medication. It wasn't as bad as I was imagining it would be. We buried the first mass that I passed on Saturday evening. I wish we had saved it in some water and buried all the remains together. We knew there would probably be more stuff coming later, but we didn't really think about it at the time. But the burial ceremony that we did of the small mass on Saturday night was really lovely. It was the saddest thing ever, but we stood in the dark over our baby's grave and vowed to never take our family for granted. My husband took a lot of ownership over the burial, which was lovely, and he said some really touching things at our ceremony. If you feel like you want to do a burial, I think it's a really healing thing to do. Afterward, I felt like I could sleep a bit easier. I was also very relieved that the second dose seemed to be working and I probably wouldn't need surgery. That may have played a role.

I very much recommend the pain medication. If, like me, you were not offered pain meds and you were not counseled about how much pain you may experienced with what is actually induced labor, I would encourage you to ask for them. I would have even waited another day to do the first dose with the pain medication. It is doable without the meds, but the pain was honestly less than half as bad with the meds.

There are several things about the care I received from my OB that I wasn't satisfied with. I made a bullet point list of those things and shared them with the practice. I don't think I was adequately prepared for what to expect. I was definitely prepared for what to look for in terms of dangerous levels of bleeding and dangerously large clots, but I did not know what was a normal progression of things and what it would feel like. I learned these things from people on this subreddit, and I'm grateful for that. Passing the tissue took some effort from me, but it did not hurt at all. I felt the urge to bare down a few times, and that's when I had my large masses pass. It didn't hurt at all, it just felt like something was inside of me and I needed to push gently to get it out. I was a little afraid to push, I didn't know what would happen, but it turned out that was the right thing to do.

I'm ok physically now, but I think I will be sad forever, just a little bit. I'm still ready for motherhood, I still intend to try again. But I will never forget this baby, the first heartbeat my husband and I made together. I hope our experience can bring you some peace, and that it is useful to someone. I'm so sorry to everyone who's reading this for the loss that led them here. None of us deserve this.

Edit for update: I found out today (12 days after I started Cytotec) that my miscarriage was incomplete. I will be having a D&amp;C sometime later this week. Wish me luck.

Update: I had the D&amp;C the morning after I was told I would need it. I was TERRIFIED. Guys, it really wasn't as horrible as I had dreamt it would be. I've read stories here of women who were awake for their D&amp;C, but I'm very grateful I was fully out under general anesthesia for mine. It was an out-patient procedure done in the ambulatory surgery unit of my local hospital. The surgery lasted about 15 minutes, and I was out for about an hour. They sent me home about an hour after I woke up, with some of those mesh hospital panties and after care instructions. Pelvic rest until cleared by an OB/gyn, drink lots of water to flush anesthesia. I had a patch behind my ear to prevent nausea. I bled like a medium flow period yesterday, and very light period bleeding today. I've had basically no pain, and what I have had is cramping that wasn't as bad as I normally get with my period.

I learned a lot from this experience, but one thing I will say is I regret how scared I was of the D&amp;C. If I had to do it over again (Dear God, please no), I would have chosen the D&amp;C from the start.",t3_huyw26
1572,Miscarriage,"I'm not sure what is going on with my emotions. My husband was watching a movie that showed a newborn baby crying. Not hurt or anything, just a freshly born baby crying their first breaths of life. I was instantly overcome with emotion and reduced to sobbing tears. I hurt so badly for the baby I lost a month ago. It was so weird because I dont feel like I have really grieved a lot for this baby, because everything was so sudden and traumatic, and I had no idea I was pregnant before I nearly bled to death. 

I just feel confused and wish to talk to someone. But I have no one at all in the world to talk to about this.",t3_hv0ccd
1573,Miscarriage,"I have been trying for a baby for 5 years. I’ve gone off and on fertility treatment a few times. At the start of quarantine we gave up going to fertility because I didn’t want to go to a hospital setting during the pandemic. And I was generally feeling hopeless. Well, late June I started feeling very bloated and my breasts sore. I hate taking pregnancy tests because they are ALWAYS read negative...So I put the symptoms up to pms. I finally gave in and on June 25th I tested positive. I had a blood test follow up confirming my pregnancy shortly after. I felt very pregnant. A few days after I felt all my pregnancy symptoms disappear. Most notably my breasts went from incredibly sore to normal over night. Last week I started cramping and spotting. I went in to the the dr last Thursday and had an ultrasound done fully expecting to have my suspected miscarriage confirmed. I was prepared for the worst news. Instead they told me I was 7 weeks, everything looked healthy, and my baby had a heart rate of 134. They said the bleeding was likely from having sex. I was so excited and finally hopeful leaving the doctors. Friday I started bleeding more heavily. Saturday my cramps and bleeding were so awful I had to get in the tub. They felt like contractions and I needed some calm. I felt a horrible cramp and stood up and I fully miscarried. I picked up the tissue, rinsed off the blood and held the perfectly clear yolk sac in my hand and looked in at my baby.  I was crying while my husband stood outside the bathroom door not knowing what to do. I didn’t know what to do with my baby. I held him in my hands for too long crying. Eventually I asked my husband through the door what I should do. I flushed my baby. I wish I hadn’t. I feel so sick over it. Yesterday I cried all day in bed. I had some slight cramping and still some bleeding.  Today I go in for a blood test so they can measure my levels and make sure all the tissue is out. I wish it were all done. I’m sorry for us all here. I hope my story didn’t offend anyone I just felt the need to get it off my chest. I’m so sad.",t3_hupmij
1574,Miscarriage,"Hey guys- first time being pregnant. Found out Friday, miscarried today (or rather am miscarrying). I was exactly 5 wks along so it’s still new. But holy s—- , these cramps are keeping me up - it feels like severe period cramps but I keep thinking I’m going to flood myself with tissue somehow, despite pad. Every clot that passes makes me sad. 

I guess I’m just struggling Bc I was excited since this was the first time I was pregnant . And I spent the whole time worrying because I started having bleeding and cramps pretty shortly after. I tried to be realistic and not get excited... but then I told my parents and my brother and my In-laws.. now I feel I have to let them down m. 

I also don’t know if I should go into work or avoid for a few days in case I continue to bleed.",t3_hv2r4n
1575,Miscarriage,"I conceived with a nexplanon birth control implant in my arm, my boyfriend and I didn’t use protection and I told him there was still a risk and he said it was fine that he’s ready for a baby with me. So I said Okay. We’ve been together for 2 1/2 years (high school sweethearts) we’re engaged, and both have careers. I started feeling weird the day after unprotected sex (weird right?), and I was like “No way. I literally just had sex last night. No way.” So I waited another day. Boom nausea. By day four of conception, it was awful, and I got a faint positive pregnancy test. So I went into the hospital to see if they could get the nexplanon removed for me. They refused and said I miscarried cause I was at zero for HCG. Bullshit. I physically felt differently and was getting HOT FLASHES! IM NINETEEN!!! So I KNEW I hadn’t. My blood pressure then sky rocketed at 200/99 (normal blood pressure is 120-128 // 60-88) and my blood pressure has NEVER been that high in MY LIFE!!! EVER. So I KNEW it was different!! 
So I went into the ER AGAIN and they still told me I was fine. So whatever right? Well day by day it gets worse. So I have a blood test done. By this time my period is late. My level was 1.2mIU-mL for HCG levels. They said it went up and I was likely pregnant. But still considered negative (anything over 5mIU/mL is considered positive, but 6mIU/mL - 24mIU/ML for HCG is a grey zone because it’s not passed 25mIU/mL which is when you can hear a heart beat of a fetus.) I just got back my second HCG test I had done on 07/13/2020 (I was 3 1/2 weeks after conception) my levels were 10.3mIU/mL... I got my period on 07/19/2020 😭 it’s HEAVY. I’ve been passing tiny clots... I’m gonna have to get another HCG test done to see if my levels go up or down, but I’m pretty sure I miscarried. I got period cramps and everything.. 😭 
I’m literally heart broken and scared. My cousin had FIVE miscarriages (my moms sisters daughter) and she is now SEVEN months pregnant with my niece (cousin is like my sister. We live together) my aunt (her mom) had a miscarriage, but was able to give birth to my cousin. My grandmothers sister had an ectopic pregnancy in her mid 20’s and had to have her entire uterus removed and almost died. So those issues run in my family. I am TERRIFIED of being infertile and having to do fertility treatments. I’m so heart broken what do I do? 🥺😭😭💔",t3_hv4cnn
1576,Miscarriage,"Hi all - I recently found this community and wanted to share my experience and get some advice from people who’ve been in similar situation.

I’m in my late 20s and did reciprocal IVF where I used my partners egg and donor sperm. The process started with much excitement and anticipation. My partner is really healthy and genetic testing came back negative for all the diseases screened for her. The donor was young and his sperm resulted in recent pregnancies as well. So we were really really hopeful. All the screening and checks were done in early February for me and my partner. Because of COVID, the transfer didn’t take place until July 6. 

The procedure itself went well. I had some spotting in the first couple of days, sore breast, fatigue. Nothing else. On 7dp5dt, all my usual symptoms were gone and I felt really good physically. On 9dp5dt, we got our beta level of 11. The clinic was cautiously optimistic. But from all I read, it was really super low. On 11dp5dt, it went up to 18. The doc also ordered tsh level to be checked. It came back 5.7+! More than doubled from February’s bloodwork. At this point, I didn’t know if it was a result of the PIO or being pregnant. But later I learned it probably was at this level before the embryo transfer. I was kinda mad, feeling the clinic dropped the ball not ordering any bloodwork for me right before the transfer, especially since the clinic claimed that they want to keep all patients’ tsh below 2.5 during the first trimester.

I continued PIO and carried on. On 13dp5dt, I did a pregnancy test on FRER and the test line was almost as dark as the control line!!! I was so excited. That would probably mean that my HCG more than tripled. I looked forward to 14dp5dt (today)’s blood draw. In the afternoon on 13dp5t, I started spotting, it was brownish. Then into the night, it became dark and the flow became heavy with small clots, almost like my usual 1st day menstrual cycle. I knew something was wrong. I tried to hold on to tiny bit of hope, but the cramps (though no back pain) continued into this morning. I went in for the blood draw, the hcg came back 25. The clinic confirmed the miscarriage/cp for me. 

I’m fairly certain the hcg went up over the weekend. Thinking of this made me cry, this little embryo put up one last fight before leaving my body last night. 

The silver lining is that the loss happened relatively fast and the physical pain wasn’t severe like described in so many posts here. 

The clinic recommends one rest cycle before resuming cycle #2. Now, I have a few questions. Excuse me if I am repeating some of the questions already asked.

We have two good embryos left. I’m thinking to go with two next time. Thoughts? 

For people with similar experience, how much did diet help? I didn’t really prepare (didn’t follow the Mediterranean diet) my body. How about exercise? I’m naturally slim and didn’t really work out/exercise much regularly. 

Anything helps. Thank you!",t3_huvsfj
1577,Miscarriage,"My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant for almost 2 years. We did a round of IUI unsuccessfully, then did IVF. Due to hormone levels with IVF she had to have an ovary removed, however we found out she was still pregnant. Had our first ultrasound 2 weeks ago and heard a heartbeat. Had our 2nd ultrasound today at 8.5 weeks and the heartbeat was gone. All my wife and I have done is cried to each other all day. I’ve never experienced this type of hurt before. And I don’t know what to do",t3_hupq0z
1578,Miscarriage,"I’m almost 7 weeks pregnant, and I’m pretty sure I miscarries again. I miscarried at 6,3 last time. So frustrating.",t3_humq7r
1579,Miscarriage,"I made a long post yesterday about my experience (first MC). I thought I passed everything over the weekend, but when I went in today, the ultrasound still showed a gestational sac inside. It was mostly collapsed, so my doctor gave me the option to wait or have a D&amp;C. I elected the D&amp;C. 

After I got home, I had some more severe cramping/contraction-like pain, and I passed another large... thing (sorry, can’t bring myself to use the right terms). I’m not cramping anymore since that’s happened.

Will they do an ultrasound before the procedure? And if I did end up passing the GS, would they still do the D&amp;C? I’m assuming they would, to make sure everything is out, but I can’t find any answers online.",t3_huxrww
1580,Miscarriage,"I went to the doctor 7-15 and was diagnosed with a blighted ovum. I stopped taking the progesterone supplements I had been on and was having consistent cramping starting Friday with light spotting. Today things picked up a lot. This is going to get graphic. My Dr's office is not picking up or calling me back. My mom is on her way to take me to the er if needed.

I started collecting tissue in an 18 Oz cup. It's almost full. I've passed 3 tennis ball sized clots with huge gushes of blood after them in the last 4 hours. Smaller clots before that. There is blood every where. I can't leave the bathroom or get far from it. I've soaked through several maxi pads (I'd say at least 4 but I've also been on the toilet at least half of the time). I almost passed out about an hour ago after trying to transition from the toilet to the shower. Does any of this sound normal?",t3_huxrw7
1581,Miscarriage,"I’ve been waiting 40 minutes for my repeat blood work. I’m in overflow seating in the main hospital lobby. At least there’s more room. But damn what a grueling wait to tell me what I already know is happening. The lab closed their Saturday hours because covid (which then makes for more packed, imo dangerous days like this). Uggghhh. This is more a vent about the lab and not the actual miscarriage itself, but hey it’s nice to have something else to be annoyed about right?",t3_huoqef

1583,Miscarriage,"Like many of you on here, I just experienced my first miscarriage. 

I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder in the past, and if I do not manage my symptoms, I will spiral into an uncontrollable depression and mania cycle. 

This will sound a little immature, but I am young (23), and this is the first time my husband and I have really experienced a loss that is hitting us this hard. 

What are some of your favorite ways to wind down/self care tips? I like listening to podcasts, writing, and using essential oils. I like baths, but I sat in the bath crying for 3 hours yesterday, so so I need something besides that. I love true crime, but I need something positive. What podcasts do you like that are positivity based? Any books that you recommend? I’m reading “It’s Not Supposed to be this Way” by Lysa Tyrekeurst right now. 

I sat in bed all day today. I just took a shower for the first time since Friday (it’s Monday). I’m a teacher in the USA, and I cannot fall apart this school year with everything happening. I need to be functioning for myself, my husband, and my students.",t3_hut215
1584,Miscarriage,Has anyone here had any tattoos? I have played around the thought of having a white falling feather in white done on  the inside of my left arm. Right where my baby's head would have lain. I want it in all white ink so it's hard to see but always there. What do you all think about it?,t3_hut0rn
1585,Miscarriage,"Not a subreddit I ever wanted to join, but here we are. My husband and I got pregnant our first month tracking and trying. We were shocked at how quickly it happened- we have friends who have been trying for years, cousins currently going through IVF, etc., so we’d ordered OPKs in bulk and were settled in for the long haul. When we found out, we were so excited and over the moon, we told a lot of our closest friends and immediate family, which I was hesitant about, but my husband reminded me that a baby is a good thing, an exciting thing, and not to worry about anything bad happening. (Hah.)

My doctor’s office scheduled my first visit for last Monday, when I was 9w6d. My anxiety had been really up and down, since my symptoms seemed to be tapering off, but everything and everyone online said that I was just one of the “lucky ones” whose symptoms fade early. When the doctor started the ultrasound, I got butterflies in my stomach as I waited to see our little tiny human... but they weren’t there. She moved the probe all around, checked everything, and then said, “So the dark area over here is your bladder. Fluid is black. Tissues are white. Over here is the gestational sac, but...” I finished her sentence, “There’s nothing there.” She repeated what I said, and I broke down. She asked about our timing, if maybe we were just really early, but there was no way. She scheduled a follow-up appointment for tomorrow (one week later) to double check. My husband and I spent the day crying and holding each other, and I’m so thankful that he’s working from home right now.

In the meantime, I had some bright red bleeding, and they had me come in on Friday. The doctor on Friday didn’t see any active bleeding sites, and sent me home with an order for more bloodwork and said they’d see me Monday.

Yesterday (Saturday), I had the strangest abdominal pain. It felt like extremely intense gas pain that I once had with food poisoning, but not cramps. I kept having to use the bathroom, and the cramps while I was in there were horrible- probably a 7-8/10. Before bed last night, I passed the first large clot. This morning, the pain woke me up. Extremely intense cramping every 2-3 minutes, several trips to the bathroom, a very hot heating pad and ibuprofen, and it eventually faded and I was able to sleep for a bit longer. When I woke up, the cramping was done. Still bleeding, but no more large clots since this morning, and I am getting a cramp here and there, but nothing like this morning.

I go back in tomorrow and I’m pretty sure they’ll see that my uterus is empty now (or close to it). I have a long list of questions. I want to fast forward a few weeks to when my period will hopefully resume so we can maybe try again. I’m definitely scared that this will happen again, and while I know most people go on to have healthy pregnancies after a miscarriage, I know there are also many women who have more. I’m also dreading the next few weeks when the next round of pregnancy announcements start, as all I’ll be able to think about is how we should have been announcing soon too.

My heart goes out to everyone in this sub. This is, without a doubt, the hardest and most painful thing I’ve ever been through. Sending lots of love to everyone in here, and hoping that we all get our miracles when we are ready.

EDIT: So I went to the doctor, and the gestational sac is still hanging in there. Having a D&amp;C on Wednesday.

EDIT 2: The D&amp;C went well, and I’m feeling pretty okay. Not anything I ever want to do again, but the hospital staff were all extremely understanding and unbelievably kind. One nurse brought me a book about miscarriage, the doctor answered the questions I had, and reassured me about the procedure. The sedation was great, I don’t remember a thing aside from joking with the OR staff about biology nerd stuff, and then waking up on the way to recovery. Not much cramping, still bleeding but light for now. Overall, I was scared yesterday and this morning, but it wasn’t a bad experience, and I’m glad that it’s all over now.",t3_huc7m8
1586,Miscarriage,"My friend is currently going through a miscarriage and I wanted to get her a little subtle something in memory of her baby, she would have been roughly 8weeks and due beginning of March, I was thinking of a Pisces star constellation in a little frame so if they did wish to display it isn’t in your face about their loss and if they don’t wish to display it they have a picture frame to use for something else. She has said they have bought a candle today to light for their baby

1587,Miscarriage,"We lost our baby last week. I’m so emotional. When i’m alone, I cry about this. During the day, my heart feels heavy from sadness and disappointment. But a part of me feels silly because I was pregnant for such a short time? Anyone else feel like this?",t3_hue0tl
1588,Miscarriage,"So, not at all sure how to use this App/Site but I needed someplace anonymous to put my thoughts down. I miscarried [loss #1] about 2 weeks ago. Definitely still grieving while trying to work at home in this health pandemic and keep functioning throughout the days. The procedure [D&amp;C] after the terrible trip to the ER was not something I ever pictured doing, much less alone given this pandemic. 

I hadn’t told anyone other than my parents I was pregnant so there are not many people to turn to for support or just to talk. And I can’t just check out for a couple days, what would I say??

My partner is not being.... I don’t even know the word. Not being “what I need,” whatever that is. Mostly it seems because I am not at all interested any providing any sort of relief/release for him. That is the LAST thing on my mind. 

I feel this will break us.  Each thinks the other is incredibly selfish for how we are reacting to this. Ugh!!!

So what to do???  I don’t have the energy in me to grieve through this and fight with him or defend my feelings all at the same time.  

From all the other posts, it seems like partners have been incredibly supportive and understanding. Anyone else feel like they are going through this alone with someone else right in the same room that should be sharing the pain?",t3_hug58c
1589,Miscarriage,"So I’m not sure if I’m having a miscarriage or if I’m just overreacting. I don’t know if I should be here either.. anyway. 

I’ve had the IUD in and it’s dislodged itself and I’m not sure when. I had unprotected sex with my partner before I realised and have been late on my period, I tested and it was negative but I was having pregnancy symptoms like with my first pregnancy, and now I’ve been having moderate cramping and spotting with old brown blood mixed with new bright red blood every few days for a few weeks now. Last night when I went to the bathroom and wiped I saw I passed what could have been a blood clot but I only get them during heavy periods and this was a time where I was only spotting mostly. It also didn’t seem like a normal clot, it was harder than normal, had next to no blood on it, and shaped like an oval, I’m not sure if it was an early embryo I passed or not. Im just confused and upset, I’m not sure what to think. Sorry for anyone I offend with this post, I just don’t know where to go.",t3_huguzy
1590,Miscarriage,"Hi! I’m 23 years old. Currently a full time student living in my own and sadly, I am experiencing my first (and hopefully only) miscarriage. I don’t have insurance, and was depending on hopefully getting Medicaid to help me through medical bills until I start working (I graduate next week!).

Needless to say, my miscarriage did not help me financially. Two trips to the ER came out to roughly $4000 that I can’t even pay, just to be told that I was losing my baby. Hurts. 

I know I need a check up, but that’s another $400 that I do not have whatsoever. 

It was an accident but I track everything because that’s just. Me lol. I was roughly 31 DPO, or 5 weeks and some days when I began bleeding, and it has been roughly 3-4 weeks since and I’m still bleeding. I have passed what I believe was the embryo :( No severe cramping, filling about 1 small pad per day. 

Is this normal? Should I be worried about missed/incomplete miscarriage?


EDIT: Thanks for the concern and advice. I’ll try what I can to go to a doctor but as of right now I feel defeated and angry with our healthcare system. Turns out the $4000 bill was only for a blood test. The other $10,000 bill for the other blood test and ultrasound came in today.

1592,Miscarriage,"Hello all, I am seeking advice as I am at a loss as to what to do and want to be a good friend to a close buddy of mine, and his wife, who have just miscarried at 8.5 weeks (found out during 12w scan, no heartbeat).

I am doing what I would assume is the right thing to do, making sure I actively listen to them both when they talk about it, respond with reassurance and check in often but not excessively, and I have sent them flowers, a gift basket and a card.

As we are in Melbourne, AUS, we are currently locked down because of COVID which makes this even harder as I can't be there for them physically, however my Wife and I, along with 2 other couples in our friendship circle got together with them via video call on Saturday night to catch up and try to be with them as much as we can in the circumstances.

Here is the bittersweet part, My wife and I have also fallen pregnant and are now at 7w4d. We aren't planning on telling them until 12w as seeing them have to go through the pain of telling people over and over is not something we want to go through if the worst were also to happen to us.

I am heartbroken as we found out before they miscarried and were so excited to share this adventure with them, this will no longer be the case.

Has anyone been through this situation? How do we tell them when the time is right? As this thread is filled with people who have been through this, how would you want to be told?

1600,Miscarriage,"Sad to be posting here, but glad I’ve found a space to share my story so far and to try and heal. Myself and my fiancé decided to start trying 3 years ago, and had our first miscarriage last April, another this March. First miscarriage I was almost 8 weeks, the second I was 6 weeks (according to my periods - sadly I never made it far enough to have my first midwife appointments /scans to confirm this) 

I had both losses confirmed at an early scan which confirmed that I had naturally lost both, and the scan showed my empty womb. I had complete miscarriages and didn’t even get to see my babies on the screen.  Both the losses were identical other than how far I had made it! So my second loss I pretty much knew straight away what was happening as soon as I started to get cramps. 

So, here we are again. Back to square one. My periods are quite irregular, I come on at different times every month, so I never know when I ovulate. This makes the process so hard, I take pregnancy tests every month as I think my period is late which is soul destroying! And expensive buying all those tests. 

I am praying for my miracle, and I’m putting this post out there as I truly believe in manifestation. I still have hope, although it’s becoming more and more painful as the time goes by without a baby in our arms. 

To finish this post off, I want you to know that I am here for ALL of you. There is little support out there for us, and it can be a very lonely and dark time! Please message me if you ever need help or a friend. Peace and love x",t3_htoss6

1602,Miscarriage,"I found out that I had a MMC at my 12 week appointment yesterday. It was my first in-person appointment due to COVID, and the US showed me measuring at only 7 weeks and no heartbeat.

I have a D&amp;C scheduled for Wednesday and opted for local anesthesia. I have a pretty high pain tolerance and it is such a quick procedure I thought may as well get it done and require less time in the hospital. I’m hoping I don’t regret that after reading the stories on here (I’m not worried about pain, but about it being mentally traumatizing with sounds).

To add insult to injury, I started spotting today and now feel incredibly nauseous (after having no morning sickness at all!). OB didn’t recommend waiting any longer since it had been 5 weeks without anything passing, but would be just my luck to have it start naturally right before the procedure. I was looking forward to it being quick. Also, still feeling pregnant in the meantime is terrible and I don’t know how I’m going to make it through 3 more days of this. 

Anyway, sad to have joined this club, and so much empathy and respect to all of you who have gone through this before. I’m thankful to have an amazing husband through all of this but damn this is terrible and I wouldn’t wish this on anyone.

I'm fine, but is that an emotion or just something people say? 
The truth, I'm everything and nothing every single day
I smile until I don't, 
I laugh until I cry,
I fall into myself,
Wishing things were different and always asking why,
I don't understand why things happen the way they do but until my heart is no longer broken,
I'm fine",t3_htmn77
1604,Miscarriage,"I had my D&amp;C the day before yesterday. Yesterday evening had bad cramping and today evening the same, only in evening. No spotting it seems today at all, whereas very very light previous. Of course now I’m freaking out that I’m going to have scar tissue etc because I made the mistake of looking up odds and all online. I had an mmc, should have been ten weeks but only measuring six and already having unexplained infertility and so afraid I’ve killed my chances having the D&amp;C. What was your experience with cramping?",t3_htwbi6
1605,Miscarriage,"I never thought I would be here in this subreddit, but here I am. 11 days ago, I found out that after 9 months of trying I was finally pregnant, all 16 tests I took confirmed it, then my HCG tests that my doctor ran confirmed it also. I was so happy, my husband was so happy, but I was so scared that something could go wrong. Then last Sunday, I started spotting very minimally and light brown... I spoke to my doctor’s nurse who said it can be very normal and not to worry unless I’m bleeding heavily like a period and cramping....well Thursday evening, I started bleeding and cramping, I knew what was happening. I called my OB two times on Friday and left two messages and never got a call back so here I am two days into this miscarriage, still bleeding and cramping and no direction of what to do now. I have accepted that this is what it is and I am devastated but what do I do now? I wanted to ask my doctor if I need to come in for them to “confirm” or what to do to care for my body during this. But they never returned my call and I have no idea what I’m supposed to do. I’ve read horror stories about women not getting checked after having miscarriages and going septic and other terrible things. I’m just not sure what to do....I’m emotionally, mentally, and physically drained.",t3_htiwnf
1606,Miscarriage,"I'm going through my second miscarriage (growth stopped at 7-8 weeks). I want to do testing, but they wouldn't schedule me for a D&amp;C until Wednesday and I think I'm going to have the miscarriage this weekend. They said if that happens to just collect the tissue myself, but wouldn't answer any of   
 my questions or give me information. Have other people done this and have advice on how to collect a sample and also how to do it without contaminating it too badly? I'm worried that if it's like my last miscarriage I won't be able to get an adequate sample. 

\[TRIGGER: graphic description of miscarriage\] Last time I had a few small clots but mostly just heavy bleeding until the embryo passed and it fell straight into the toilet. I was also having terrible cramping and intestinal issues and (apologies for the TMI) I was basically gushing from everywhere. If that happens again how am I supposed to separate this out? I'm sorry this is gross but I am so overwhelmed and I can't find any information, other than that a lot of at-home tissue collections are inadequate. I'm scared of going through this again now that I know what's coming, but I don't think I can live with not even being able to do the testing.

1607,Miscarriage,"I’ve had two early losses, one that didn’t weigh very heavily on me, and another one that has. It continues to give me a feeling of heartbreak, almost as if the wind gets knocked out of me when I think about it. But, somehow, this crazy year has given me the chance to start something new. I became a doula, not directly because of my losses, but because I feel so strongly about pregnancy and birth, and I think I can help people process these things. My focus is in helping parents of loss and traumatic birth. I hope this helps others, and I hope as time goes on I won’t get this feeling in my chest when I think about my own loss. Something is pulling me toward it, toward advocating, but it is painful. I just know it’s right though, however hard it is at this time. Anyway, that’s how I’m coping right now.",t3_ht840d
1608,Miscarriage,"How do you cope? How do you feel? How do you move anywhere from the pain in your heart? 

On Wednesday I delivered my son at 17weeks 3days. The previous Thursday I went with hope to my monthly OB check up that things we’re looking up. I had been having some serious nausea and vomiting through the beginning of my pregnancy. I thought it was getting better but the night before my appointment I was sick for hours. We discussed what I could be doing different and she had me hop up on the exam table to listen to baby’s heartbeat. Silence. She called for the ultrasound. Silence. I saw my baby curled up peaceful in my belly not moving. She called the ultrasound tech in the room to have her get a better look. The tech was not comfortable with the portable equipment and had me go to the ultrasound rooms in the office for a full check. Silence. I was 16weeks 4days and they said his heart must have recently stopped. I was paralyzed. In the midst of COVID I was at the doctor, alone, getting the crushing news that I had lost my baby. I called my husband to pick me up and we cried in the middle of the parking lot. 

I was scheduled to be induced on Tuesday morning. The hospital and staff were amazing. Wednesday morning I delivered my perfect son, Oliver, he was beautiful. I got the chance to hold him and love him and say the hardest goodbye I have ever had to do. The whole process was beautifully horrible. They have done so many tests and an autopsy to find nothing wrong, he was perfect. 

This was not my first loss, I miscarried at 8 weeks, then I was blessed with an amazing little boy who fills my life with love, then again at 6 weeks and now this. I am heartbroken. Scared to ever go through this again and scared that I will never have another baby. 

My son is two and he knows something is wrong. I feel like a shell this week. I don’t even know how to move from this point. I am the rock in our family, and I feel shattered. Trying to be strong for him and my husband is overwhelming. I know I need to allow time to grieve but the thought of facing this makes me sick. 

I am daunted by the day I have to face the world. The world that I proudly announced our pregnancy after we were “safe”. The world that I proudly showed off my bump to. The world that had so much love for this baby. To tell anyone our loss breaks me to pieces. 

I look down at my empty belly and hate everything. I’m mad, I’m hurt, I’m sad, I’m empty.",t3_htmu91
1609,Miscarriage,"Hello.
I really didnt know where else to go. What to say or what to do. And i think i just needed to do this to start to heal.
28 (f) and first pregnancy. I found out i was pregnant the day before my birthday, it was wonderful, my husband and i were NTNP as we had just moved into our new house. It was a blessing. We told our best friends and our parents. I had my 7 weeks scan and they said it was perect. Good heartbeat. Foetus sitting high. See you at week 10 for nipt and scan. Great i thought. The same day i had my scan i started to have some brown discharge, it was so weird. I thought maybe they bumped something on my internal ultrasound. I was so worried i booked in for another ultrasound the next day. Again ultrasound was perfect, heartrate was even stronger and i was measuring a day ahead. The spotting continued with a slight of red, i spoke to my dr who said to come in for a pelvic exam and swabs (maybe it was an infe tion they said). After that pelvic exam and swabs i started to bleed more this time with clots. I knew something was wrong i called my doc and she said to go straight to the hospital. I did. It was crazy due to corona. It was something like out of a movie. My hcg was done which they said was good.but once i finally got to my ultasound the cramps had started and the bleeding had become heavier. Once in the ultrasound you could see the sack and the foetus in it, but the heart beat. Oh god it breaks my heart. The heartbeat was struggling. Even i could see that. They confirmed prognosis was bad and they were sorry. And once they left the room i called my husband and my parents to tell them the bad news. I was taken to the ward and given some options. My dr was amazing. Like AMAZING. He gave me all the options and sat with me as no visitors could be on the ward. Exactly one  month to the day of finding out i was pregnant i started to miscarry. None of it feels real yet. I think i am still in shock. But what makes me cry the most is it feels like someone has died. And usually when someone dies i think of all the happy memories i have of them. But sadly i have no memories. And that is what is the hardest thing for me. My husband is great, he holds me when i am sad and tells me to take it one day at a time. Ive never felt pain like this before. I just wanted to share my story. I didnt want to forget amd i want to be strong enough so that when people ask i can be honest. Because 1 in 4 is quite common. Thinking of all the people who have gone through or are going through this experience and wishing you peace and calmness❤",t3_htctfi

How the crying comes in waves, thinking about how my first ultrasound was to find out that there was only a sac, now I can’t think of a birthing center or the emergency room, how the hospital basically let me bleed out my miscarriage on the bed... it’s all too much for me.

I’m sorry that we all have to be here in this group but I’m also grateful that it has brought us here together to talk about it and comfort each other during such a difficult time in our lives.

1617,Miscarriage,"Our baby's due date is coming up on August 7th. It's not fair. I should be nesting right now, not grieving. The nursery should have been set up, and I would have been washing and hanging up baby clothes. Instead, the crib is still in its box, shoved into the corner of an unpainted and otherwise empty room.

Her due date is two days before our sixth wedding anniversary. Six years, we've waited for her. She was a gift. One we've wanted for so long. And now she's gone. We don't have the heart to celebrate our anniversary this year. I don't know if it's because of COVID so we don't feel comfortable going out, or if that's just an easy excuse to ignore the pain of the two coinciding events.

I took the due date off work. Our only plans are to go to a specialty bakery and getting cupcakes. Beyond that, I don't know how we'll manage. How can we cope with the pain and still honor the day of our child's birth and our wedding. Both feel like days that are the culmination of our love, but both are now filled with pain and sadness.

Anyways, I started spotting today. Again. I stopped after about 2 days once d&amp;c was over but why is it starting again? Is this normal? My doctor’s response was “yes”. I kind of want more explanation?

I go in again on Tuesday for another scan (doctors request just to confirm, even though I am 100% sure on my date of conception and LMP). Has anyone else dealt with bleeding that lasted this long?

After using misoprostil, I felt ""back to normal"" in about 48 hours. Meaning, I didn't feel pregnant anymore. All of my symptoms were immediately gone. 

Its been 24 hours since my D&amp;C, but  I still feel weird. I know that's not much time. I've been Feeling nauseous and tired all day. Also woke up at 3:30 am last night which is a pregnancy symptom for me. I also haven't had too much bleeding, but some cramping.

1628,Miscarriage,"Hello all,

This is my first time posting, so please any first time posting errors or ignorance. I just discovered this sub, and it has helped me with the process of healing after my miscarriage.

I'll try to by as concise as possible so this doesn't become a long read for anyone reading that can give me some answers. Following my miscarriage, which happened at 6 weeks due to blighted uterus, I have gone back in for multiple blood draws due to my high HCG levels. My doctor has been keeping a close eye on these levels and I have taken at home pregnancy tests which all test positive for pregnancy. I have had two regular periods since my miscarriage, and my doctor is now going to have me see another doctor next week to continue testing to see why my HCG level is still so high, despite regular periods/definitely am not pregnant any more. For the record, my HCG level post miscarriage was 25, 18, 15, 13, and is now 12 as of yesterday. She said she has never seen someone have high levels after miscarriage and regular bleeding. My question is, does anyone have a similar experience they can share with me? 

Googling what this can mean is absolutely terrifying, and I have already read about the many different types of issues this can be. My doctor said she'll be speaking with an oncologist next week, which of course sent me straight into spiralling into thinking I may have cancer. 

I'm not looking for a diagnosis but I would love to hear similar stories or opinions on what this could mean. I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has if it helps narrow anything down. Thank you all in advance.",t3_hskowm

I apologize in advance if this isn’t the place to post. Please let me know and I will adjust accordingly.

My grandmother passed away in January. I thought things were looking up when we found out about our second baby in May but we lost little one on July 6.

Both times we saw a heartbeat then lost the baby. The first time baby stopped growing at 8 weeks and found out  at week 10. The second time baby stopped growing at 9 weeks and we found out at week 12.

My OB already has me scheduled for an appointment next week to check up and see if I was able to expel everything on my own...

Now, shortly after I started looking for something to do to encourage me along as learning about the miscarriage broke my belief system. I got a dog in May and named him Kyanite. Well now almost every time I look at my dog I remember the miscarriage. I had previously tried growing plants as I was just longing for the ability to watch something living grow and live a life, but they died. Well, a few days ago I finally regained a belief system and not as often but I still think about the miscarriage multiple times. Sometimes I regret getting the dog as he reminds me of it many times.

1635,Miscarriage,"I'm wondering what type of post-care you received after miscarriage?

A couple days ago I started having pink spotting. Late last night it turned red. This morning bright red like period blood, cramping, and I felt something pass while on the toilet. I didn't look at it. 7 weeks along. Already had an appointment for an ultrasound today (pregnancy from ivf transfer). Nurse confirmed nothing in the uterus. Did hsg, level around 15000.

Clinic calls and they want me back in for another ultrasound to check for ectopic. I guess because the hsg level is high. I've had no symptoms of ectopic. I don't really want to go back in because my insurance probably won't cover it and honestly all I want to do tomorrow is curl up with a blanket and watch TV all day. Also feels like my clinic is being overly concerned about it? Is there this much testing for miscarriages not from ivf? I just want to have some time and not run around to doctors offices all day.",t3_hsj1lm
1636,Miscarriage,"Due to my suicidal ideation, in spite of refusal of all treatment, they administered some IV drugs like methotrexate and something else.  


This was the most unique mc experience I have had. Any others have just been natural. This was the only one...a MMC...where my body was holding onto tissue that could have supposedly made me sick enough to die. I said I wanted to die and they could never go inside of me so they gave me drugs. But it took...weeks...and I was struggling with a psychosis and I was 19. My mom, not being used to not having all my medical information, hurt me pretty badly by insisting that it was part of my psychosis. I guess it took years to processes. I was heavily drugged with stuff like haldol, benadryl, and the other drug they give you in those b3s. But I think the worst part about a psych ward mc was how they treated it like nothing. They flushed my baby. They drugged me. I fainted and had to be assisted with some weird contents of conception that came after the fetus. I was roughly 14-15 weeks. My previous mc was practically just chemical. I lost it the day after I got the BFP and it was painful, but I would have never known without that late period and test.

1638,Miscarriage,"Going through a MC has been the most physically and emotionally painful thing I’ve ever experienced. I don’t really want to discuss details with friends or family but I feel like I need to write out my experience so I’m coming here. I read things online about other women’s experiences and I know it depends person-to-person as well as how far along you are. I just never read about such graphic experiences (although I now understand why you wouldn’t want to plaster the internet with this) and am curious how many other women had a similar event. Long read ahead.


TLDR; MC was emotionally draining and surprisingly physically traumatic. Feelsbadman.


I found out on Monday at 9w3d that there was no heartbeat and the baby had stopped growing at around 8w5d. I had started spotting right around the ~8w4d mark but it was pretty light so I wasn’t concerned until the spotting hadn’t gone away and I just didn’t feel pregnant anymore. I talked to my doctor and opted to just wait for everything to pass normally (mistake). Stayed home from work on Tuesday and woke up with some slight cramping and back pain and increased spotting. At around 3:30 pm I started bleeding heavily and experiencing more painful cramping. By 5:30 I was bleeding profusely (soaking a pad every 20-30 minutes) and the cramping had turned in to what felt like contractions every 2-3 minutes. This was by far the worst pain I had ever felt in my life and I had a ruptured appendix when I was 18. I threw up twice from the pain. By 7:00 I was in so much pain I could barely walk or talk and the bleeding was so severe I had my husband drive me to the emergency room.


Before they could even start an exam they had to pump me full of morphine and Zofran because I could barely speak full sentences without crying in pain. When the pain finally became manageable an ER doc did an ultrasound and exam to confirm what was happening. Because the bleeding was so severe I had to wait for the on-call OBGYN to come do an exam as well. She immediately said I should have a D&amp;C to get everything out and hope that helped stop the bleeding and pain. Luckily given the circumstances a visitor waiver was made so my husband could be with me (thanks covid). Even with the pain medication and lidocaine, the D&amp;C sucked pretty hard, y’all. At least there was some tissue left so the OB said they’d send to the lab to analyze and maybe find answers about what happened. I then had to stay for a few hours to be monitored and make sure the bleeding died down and I wasn’t so nauseous anymore.


The doctors were so nice and empathetic but the entire experience was so traumatic, and I don’t use that word lightly. I feel like my internet sleuthing to understand what would happen to me did such a disservice to prepare myself. It was humbling, to say the least.

1640,Miscarriage,"I didn’t realize how much it would impact me emotionally seeing blood today for the first time since my medicated miscarriage. I guess I was secretly holding out hope that I would get pregnant without having another devastating bleed. 
Today a friend who knew about my MC and I had asked her to not talk to me about our TTC journeys anymore while I’m healing emotionally told me she just found out she was pregnant. I went and cried privately at work and that is when I noticed I was bleeding. 

I had been doing pretty well, wasn’t crying anymore upon discussing it with my close friends and family and today I just feel totally derailed. 

I hate the wedge I feel between my pregnant friends.. their successful pregnancies are just a reminder of what I no longer have.  I worry that they’re going to hate me for distancing myself from them while I feel this way.  I’m just so sick of this sadness and sick of feeling triggered out of the blue.",t3_hs43op

I’m wondering how long you waited till trying again? How you emotionally got to the point of feeling like you could handle trying again? 
I feel like I go back and forth on being mentally ready to try again...I know I’m probably not physically ready but mentally I have days were I’m ready and other days where I’m thinking we won’t try till next year... also I dunno if we need to do any testing to make sure we should even try again... 
I’m feeling very overwhelmed and defeated and just have very little hope.",t3_hs4ux2
1642,Miscarriage,"On Sunday night, I miscarried without even knowing I was pregnant. I had just assumed that the cramps I were feeling were because of a late period I was expecting. I knew something felt different with this “period” because it started off as spotting (which never happens to me), but I still tried to get through the cramping &amp; pain. Well, later that evening I got an extremely sharp pain in my stomach &amp; just went to the bathroom to sit on the toilet while the cramp passed. As I was sitting there, I had another sharp pain &amp; then I heard something drop in the toilet. Panicking, I looked in the toilet &amp; saw it. I started hyperventilating &amp; went into complete shock while trying to hold back my sobs. I was so traumatized that I didn’t even flush the toilet, I just left it there &amp; have been sleeping at my boyfriend’s house ever since. I feel so guilty for doing that, but I didn’t know what else to do. I feel like my body &amp; mind just went numb for the time being. 

I couldn’t believe that this happened to me again. My first MC happened when I was 18 years old &amp; I didn’t even know that it was a miscarriage. I just went to the hospital assuming I had stomach pain &amp; didn’t expect to leave knowing I had lost a baby. Being so young, I went into a complete depression that eventually caused me to drop out of college. I never was able to cope with what happened &amp; constantly blamed myself for what happened. It was so hard &amp; still is. It’s been 4 years since the first one &amp; now this one. I just feel so empty &amp; full of so many questions &amp; self hatred. Why me? What could I have done to prevent this? Why again? So many questions &amp; no answers. I just don’t know how to begin coping for this MC when I haven’t even processed the first one. I’m heartbroken..",t3_hs40xe

1645,Miscarriage,"Not even sure why I’m posting this just want to say that this is mcc #4 and apparently cytotec wasn’t enough to get all the products out of my uterus so now I’m having a d and c one month after I took cytotec and passed most of the pregnancy.  

My husband slept through the night that I took the cytotec and missed the whole miscarriage.  after explaining to him and the therapist how deeply I resented him for that, he said that he wants to be supportive and he doesn’t want me to feel alone.  I think saying that I felt alone after he decided to sleep while I delivered our dead baby and hemorrhaged into the toilet helped him to understand that sleeping through my miscarriage was not what I meant when I said “I need you to be here woth me while I go through this”.

I thought it was common sense, especially since we’ve been through 4 mmc.  But apparently it wasn’t clear to him and he was confused about what I needed.  

Today when I asked him to drive me to the hospital for the d and c he suggested that he work the night before and sleep in the car while I had surgery so he would be driving me over an hour away from home on 2 hours sleep....

I told him that I felt incredibly hurt and alone and resentful because of how unsupportive he has been.  He says he wants to be supportive and just doesn’t know how and I was like I just specifically told you how you could be supportive and asked for your help and you basically dismissed what I asked in favor of your own needs. 

Anyhow it sucks to go through this and it sucks to have an unsupportive clueless partner.  I have read some articles about how pregnancy loss can destroy relationships and am just wondering if I’m anyone else has struggled with their relationship after miscarriage.  I have pretty much decided that I’m going to give it 6-12 months before I decide to leave the relationship to give myself time to heal from the miscarriages before making any decisions but the way things are going between us I’m not sure I can live with a person who has been so distant and unkind during such a difficult period of time.  Anyone else been in this kind of situation before?  It’s like I keep hoping he’ll suddenly get it..but it doesn’t seem to click.  I just keep comparing how he has treated me to what I would have done if he was in my shoes and I feel horrible because I can see how little effort he has put into being there for me.  

And yes I know he is grieving too but wtf ?   I have spent the past 12 months going from doctor to doctor (woohoo met my out of pocket maximum and deductible) and dealing with all the poking and prodding and bills and meds and paperwork and phone calls and pregnancy sickness and bleeding and hormone shifts and my husband doesn’t offer to be 100% there for me when I need him?

1647,Miscarriage,"My miscarriage bleeding started on 6/18 at 9w, 2d and I passed a lot of tissue/clotting over the next 5 days. My bleeding continued for almost 3 weeks, until 7/7. For the past two days I've been spotting and cramping- it felt different than my normal cycle, but I figured my period was about to start. Today I felt a gush of fluid and went to the bathroom and passed a large piece of tissue (whitish pink membrane - exactly like the tissue passed during the start of my miscarriage) followed by a bunch of dark red clots. About an hour later I had a large volume of sticky, clear discharge, but no further bleeding since then. My hCG has been very slow to come down, but was at 27 as of yesterday. My NP told me that she wasn't worried about my levels because they have continued (slowly) dropping every week; they're only concerned about retained tissue if hCG stops dropping completely. Has anyone had a similar experience of tissue passing so long after the start of a miscarriage?  I've got myself all worked up about incomplete miscarriage and all the possible terrible complications. It really freaked me out and has brought me pretty much back to square one emotionally. It just feels like the physical symptoms will never be over.",t3_hrzlx8
1648,Miscarriage,"Hello,

I am here after back to back CPs (and a CP back in September of 2019). Both pregnancies were a bit of a fluke, if I'm honest. I took a test both days my period was due. The first time, my test was light, so light that I just kind of assumed I'd MC anyway. It never felt right. I did miscarry a day or two later. 

 The second test was more of a fluke: I took a test on a whim, it was just there, in my bag and I took it for funsies. Boom, prominent, and I was... excited! Symptoms and everything. I was elated and thought ""this is it! This is my take home baby!""

But that was short lived as today, at 4w4d, I am in the process of miscarrying.

I am sad but unsurprised. 

I have Graves (which is managed) and believe this is the source of my CPs. Despite my levels being in the middle range, I believe the Graves is still causing my chemicals by not providing the hormones necessary for sustaining pregnancy.  I am trying not to be too sad, too upset. Fortunately, my OB is aggressive with treatment. I plan on requesting a full battery of hormonal bloodwork.

But I am sad never the less. I wanted this LO so badly. I wasn't surprised by the outcome but it still hit me kind of hard. I'm really, really hoping this can all be solved with medication adjustment, supplement addition or something simple like that. For now, I'm just going to be sad until I am ready to pick myself up and not be sad.",t3_hrw5ax
1649,Miscarriage,"About 4 months ago, I found out I was about 2 months pregnant shortly after having been cheated on and filing a restraining order against the dad.. After I found out, in my heart I wanted to keep it. I already had a connection to it, I didn’t feel alone somehow while I had this little bean inside of me even while I actually was alone and had no support at all. But deep in my mind, I tried being logical about it and how the child would suffer with having a 17 year old mother with no experiences that has barely gotten her life started in a very unstable relationship with the father and no financial and emotional support whatsoever. That’s what I was constantly reminded by my family on a daily basis and by the father himself telling me what the best decision would be after coming into contact with him for the baby’s sake and support. I was being rushed to just make a choice already when everything was happening so quickly and all of the pressure from everyone around me got to me, I gave in and made the decision that I’ll always regret deeply. The experience itself of having a surgical abortion for the first baby was traumatic in itself, I will never forget that moment, me feeling the instant regret as soon as I came into the room and crying and screaming for help as it was happening but nothing being done to help. I will never forget when I had that first ultrasound, the baby was 7 weeks and seemed to be healthy, I heard the heartbeat and couldn’t help but cry yet I remember how I can never turn back that decision I made and how I gave into what everyone else thought was best. In the midst of trying to recover and suppress the physical and emotional pain inside of me I fell back into the relationship I was in before and the cycle of keeping the emotions of the loss I experienced tucked away but I couldn’t forget. Two months later, the same intuitive feeling inside of me returned that I felt the last pregnancy before I found out physically I knew it mentally. I was already having emotional grief and guilt about the first baby I had lost from my own selfish choice, it was chipping away at the numb exterior I was portraying to look strong and I couldn’t help but also feel anxiety. I won’t forget that day I went to the planned parenthood center and they took a urine test telling me I’m pregnant again, the amount of emotions I felt at once and flashbacks I received was overwhelming,  just earlier that day I was holding back tears thinking about my baby that I had lost before and knowing I can’t turn back time. This time I promised myself to not give in to others thoughts, knowing I can’t let myself go through that same mentally and physically excruciating process and carry the same regret and pain that I still do with my first child. I started mentally making a plan for our futures, having vivid dreams about me months later into the pregnancy, thinking of names and feeling hopeful within myself to make the right decision this time. While at the same time, feeling selfish for the decision that I made for my first pregnancy. I finally made the appointment for the ultrasound, going in excited to see the baby for the first time and how it’s developed after 7 and 1/2 weeks. I remember the moment it was happening, something wasn’t right I thought, the room was painfully silent as I saw both the sonographer and counselor watch the screen worriedly. I wondered why I wasn’t being shown the ultrasound on the screen or asked to hear the heartbeat this time, as I flashed back to my first ever ultrasound and how distinctively different that moment and energy surrounding the room was. That’s when the transducer was removed and I was told that unfortunately, there hasn’t been any heartbeat detected and the fetus had stopped developing at the 5 week mark. At that moment I felt all of the worlds weight had been crashing down on me, I couldn’t help but blame myself and thinking it’s my fault. Thinking, I’m being punished for the decision I made before and it must’ve been something I’ve done. I couldn’t help but feel empty and sit alone on my bed most times and just cry, I still tried to be hopeful thinking there could be a miracle somehow and it could be an error waiting on the next ultrasound and to my dismay there was no change. I spent the next two weeks trying to cope, not knowing what to do waiting for the loss to occur naturally since it was confirmed to be a missed miscarriage and that’s when it happened suddenly. It’s been 4 days and I’m still bleeding heavily, yesterday I realize I must’ve passed the placenta and sac itself and since then I can’t get the mental picture out of my head, I feel numb and I’ve never felt so alone. I can’t help but feel reminded of my first pregnancy and the decision I made as well as realize the loss of this baby too. I’m trying to cope but it’s so hard, especially knowing what’s to come, I know breast milk will be coming in soon and I dread the feeling of it hurting again and constantly lactating milk to nurse a baby that is no longer alive. I want to get a tattoo symbolizing both babies I’ve lost, as a permanent way of commemorating them as I will always love them and never forget.",t3_hru7vv

1652,Miscarriage,"This was my first time being pregnant and it has been an overwhelming and confusing experience. 

I started spotting on 1st June (which was day 19 of my cycle. I have PCOS so I don’t really know when or if I ovulate). I’ve never had spotting before and it didn’t stop so I took a pregnancy test on 6th June which was positive. I was in complete shock as we had only just started trying that month. 
I had a blood test the following week, my hCG was 15 and the spotting continued. I had another blood test a couple of days later and my hCG was still really low at 17. On 13th June I started bleeding which progressively became heavier until tapering off around 18th June.

Again, my hCG was tested and it was 7. Since then the spotting and occasional light bleeding hasn’t stopped. I had a light period on 7th-10th July but now it’s gone back to the brown discharge/light bleeding.

It's not that I'm pulling them out and looking at them. I was cleaning out under the bathroom sink the other day and instead of throwing them away I just tucked them into a basket.

1654,Miscarriage,"She’s 30 and I’m 31. We were trying for a short while, she missed her period and I hoped. She tested and surprised me with the test results. There were 2 lines! We were overjoyed. We went for the first OBGYN appointment and found that she was 6 weeks+ pregnant and everything was fine. We heard the heartbeat and I almost fainted. 8 weeks we had another appointment and everything was great! 
We got married (planned earlier and not because of the pregnancy) 3 days ago. 
Today was the OBGYN appointment. She was supposed to be 11 weeks +. When the OBGYN scanned, I knew something was wrong. The obgyn looked up and said, ‘there’s no heartbeat.’ And it stopped growing at 9 weeks+.
I immediately went over and held my wife’s hand. She was just looking at the screen and she was quiet. She was quiet all the way throughout till we went out the doors.
She broke down. So did I. 

We had a second opinion scheduled and we went for it. We cried on and off while waiting. The scan results went straight to the obgyn but we knew what the result was going to be. We went to the car and cried. I felt so helpless. I still feel helpless and sad. We cried, binge ate and cried again. We’ve been taking turns to cry and talk about how we feel. We’ve been crying the whole day now and she just managed to fall asleep. It’s been the hardest day. It’s been the hardest day..

I came here and I read through the posts and I know we are not alone. It’s just so overwhelming. Words cannot describe how heartbroken we are and it breaks my heart even more to see my wife cry, knowing how much pain she is in. 

TLDR: MC at 9 weeks. Found out today. Tough tough day. I don’t know what to do.

They actually thought I had COVID/some kind of virus, but it came back negative, and my blood work came back totally normal. The doctor said he believes it's from depression/anxiety.

1658,Miscarriage," I found out on Thursday I was pregnant and later, after severe pain and a trip to the ER, they could not find the embryo. My hCG levels indicated I was about 4-5 weeks and the ultrasound showed no abnormalities on my ovaries or blood flow to them. My endometrium is normal and does not show thickening due to pregnancy (4mm). The doctor took my lab work the next day and my hCG levels went down and I was discharged  but needed to f/u 2 days later to monitor the hCG levels. When I went back in Monday they weren't as high as they were on Thursday but they higher than they were when I was discharged. Another ultrasound was done and they were still not able to find the embryo. The doctor wanted to do exploratory surgery but I have never had any surgery, so I asked if I could wait. I am going back tomorrow to do more blood work and see if my levels have continued to decrease. They believe it is either a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy but aren't able to tell me what is going on. I have minimal spotting and mild cramping still. My stomach was distended and I have fluid in my pelvic area they believe is blood. Over the last 2 days the distention has gone down a lot.  I had been experiencing this abdominal pain/cramping and spotting up to a month before finding out I was pregnant. I am just wondering if anyone has any insight on their own experience with a fluctuating hCG levels or an ectopic pregnancy? They never offered a D&amp;C or meds for an ectopic. I am just terrified I had a miscarriage and my body hasn't gotten rid of all the tissue. I would rather avoid surgery at all cost but know if its ectopic its needed.

1659,Miscarriage,"First and foremost I am not looking for medical advice, juat other women's experiences with this.

I have some light brown spotting still and am getting my HCGs checked weekly. My level yesterday was 31. 

My doctor okayed me to resume sex but has suggested we use birth control until after my first period. We FINALLY had sex last night using condoms (havent done that in about 12 years as we've been together 13yrs). I bought a box of 3 and literally all 3 broke before either of us finished. It was so frustrating. 

I talked to a nurse today who basically told me that they're no longer concerned about a pelvic infection but about pregnancy. She said it would be hard to tell if the pregnancy would be healthy, should that happen. What does this even mean?

My sister in law told me she got pregnant with her now 8yr old after her MC but before her first period. What are you guys being advised to do? I just figure that I didn't miscarry due to a physical issue, so what would be the problem if I got pregnant again? My biggest issue is I want to have sex and condoms freaking suck.

1663,Miscarriage,"&amp;#x200B;

Mother's day I found out we would become parents for the first time.  I was 33 husband 35. Been trying since January.  I even took a photo of myself once I found out as that's what google told me to do when I googled “how should I feel about being pregnant” said to do..  I planned how I would tell my husband out to the T. I couldn't wait to tell him..  I brought him down by the lake to tell him and as much as I wanted to be excited I just wouldn't allow myself because I was worried I'd fall in love and lose the baby.  I figured if I didn't love it the pain wouldn't be so great.  Boy was I wrong.. We also did not tell more than about 5 people as we wanted to wait until we were out of the clear.  I’ve always heard about miscarriages but I never once thought “oh this could happen to me.”  About five weeks in I started to notice some brown bleeding.  I had a random episode where my vision went really blurry and I saw zig zags in one eye.  I got worried between the two and contacted my OBGYN to see what they felt.  They referred me back to my primary for the vision issues but scheduled an Ultrasound in a week or two so we could just make sure everything was okay from the bleeding.  I did bleed up until week eight when it magically just stopped(I took this as a good sign...but it wasn't.)  A few times bright red but mostly brown.

The first ultrasound came quick. I was not expecting to see a lot since I was still just a few weeks into the pregnancy.  The ultrasound didn't really show much other than the yolk and the sac.  They warned me there and then that the pregnancy may not be viable and the sac was an abnormal shape/size for how far along I was.  I left that day feeling hopeless like I'd already lost my baby.  They wanted me to come back in about 10 days for a recheck to see if I made any progress. I tried thinking of what I may have done wrong or could have done to prevent the baby from growing.

Fast forward to the next Ultrasound June 4th.  My husband waited in the car due to COVID issues.  I went in and finally at the end we saw a heartbeat. I couldn't make anything out other than that small flicker.  My hopes had come back and I started crying and shaking.  I apologized to the tech and told her I'm so sorry I'd believed for all this time it was gone.  She gave me a print out of my peanut and that's all I have left of it to this day.  I saw the doctor and the size was still not measuring where they wanted but asked me to come back in 15 more days for another Ultrasound.  Little did I know that its heartbeat was not within the range they wanted it. I didn't find that out until my last ultrasound.  

Fast forward again to the last ultrasound June 15th.  My husband again waited in the car.  The ultrasound tech looked around for a bit.  A lot quieter than the last two.  Finally at the end she stopped and looked up at me and the words I’ll never ever forget “Im sorry there is no heartbeat” came out of her mouth.  I laid there trying to compose myself and she asked if I minded if she continued to get a few more photos of my ovaries for the doctor.  Finally they brought me back to the room and they asked if they could call anyone.  The nurse finally let my husband come in(after asking her boss for permission) with a mask and all I could do is hold him and apologize over and over.  I felt I'd failed us and that the one thing I should have been able to do is carry our child.  The doctor came in and answered all of our questions we had and gave me our three options.  To wait to see if my body would have a natural miscarriage, to go home and have an induced miscariage with pills, or the d&amp;c.  The doctor gave us some time to think and talk it over.  She said that sometimes the first two options fail and a d&amp;c is needed anyways.  We did choose the D&amp;C and scheduled that out.  I did end up needing a COVID19 test. 

Fast forward 2 days I was in day surgery.  I had a day between to grieve and be left with my racing thoughts of “Are they sure it's gone?  Am I sure this is what's best?”  This was June 17th. They allowed my husband back into pre op with me.  I continued to have racing thoughts of doubt. I finally asked the doctor who wasn't the same obgyn from the office if she felt this was the best option.  She reassured me that she felt it was without a doubt.  She gave us the best advice and wisdom I've had since the start of all of this.  She mentioned people don't want to talk about miscariage.  If they haven't been through one they don't know what to say to me/us.  SOme will want to talk about it and some will give me/us words/advice that shouldn't really be said.  The  Surgery went well. I was only under general anesthesia for about a half hour.  She said I had about 8 weeks of tissue so their timing was about right at nine weeks.  The nurses checked my pads and did end up giving me a low does of fentanyl.  I wasn't sent home with my pain killers or anything like that.  I was glued to my heating pad that day.  I wasn't scheduled a follow up until 4 weeks out(and no blood work) which is next week.  I continued to bleed not enough for a pad in 2 hours but at first I was going through 2 jumbo pads a day.  I would pass clots and tissue the size of quarters.  

Last fast forward.  I am still testing positive on a pregnancy test.  I've watched my HCG tests become solid lines and now watching the one solid line fade away.  At first I just wanted the bleeding to stop.  Thinking that would make me feel better.  Now I keep telling myself I just want my period so we can start trying again.  I really am starting to think I need to speak to a therapist because at least once a day something reminds me I'm not pregnant any longer and my whole mood changes.  Even when I sleep it happens now in my dreams.  My friends and family try really hard to get me to talk about it or reassure me they are here to listen.  I just keep wondering to myself where do I go from here?   I've put all of the baby stuff we got away along with the photo and positive pregnancy test.  I am 1 in 4.  I still can't believe I'm now a statistic.  If it's so common, why don't more women talk about it?  Coming here has been hard.  I avoided reading questions/stories here.  Telling my story has been hard but after a recent covid baby thread I felt it was time.  everyone joked about a covid baby boom and yes I would have had a covid baby era however we started way before that. If you made it this far I thank you.  Im sorry for your loss and hope that my story helps you answer any questions or even feel like you're not alone...

TL:DL I was pregnant, had brown bleeding, was told it's not viable, saw a heartbeat the following US, and then was told no heartbeat at the last US.  We chose D&amp;c and now waiting for my period.",t3_hqsuwf
1664,Miscarriage,"I went in for my 10 week ultrasound today and was gonna heart the heartbeat for the first time. But as soon as the tech scanned my belly and couldn’t find the heartbeat, I knew. I knew what it meant when she switched to the vaginal ultrasound and didn’t find anything right away. I knew what it meant when she sadly sighed. She asked if I still wanted a picture and I quickly said no. My husband was there for this, and my heart is breaking for him too. I’m shattered that he’s in pain actually. I’m absolutely shattered that he’s so completely devastated. He sobbed on the way home and, here’s the thing about me; I hate being emotional in front of people. I’m like a wounded animal, I just wanna disappear and be alone until I’m well enough to face someone again. So watching him sob for the heartbreak and the disappointment and the disbelief, I broke. My soul actually felt broken. I feel like I’ve disappointed everyone. I’m a perfectionist so this is such a loss for me. I not only feel the loss of my baby that we were so excited for, but the loss of the first grandchild, the first step to a crazy journey that we’ve dreamed of, the joy in the cutest things I bought for the long awaited announcement, all of it. I can’t even think of all the things right now because all I feel is broken. Deleting the apps, unfollowing the subs and instagram pages, hiding the books and other reminders so I don’t have to look at them. So I don’t have to feel their presence around me. 
Not to mention the heartbreak of knowing baby stopped growing 3 weeks ago. How? How could this happen to me, when I was so sick and constantly vomiting? How could this happen when my husband and I were so ready and so excited? We announced it to my husbands immediate family during those 3 weeks and that probably hurts the worst. Not knowing that it wasn’t even there...not knowing our celebration would soon turn to mourning and sadness...not knowing that all the plans we had would soon be nothing more than imagined scenarios...
Thanks for listening. I know this is long and I’m sorry. But thanks for giving me this space to grieve and just wallow in the heartbreak. Thanks for being someone who understands.",t3_hqkk59
1665,Miscarriage,"We found out I was pregnant about 3.5 weeks ago. I had never felt so much joy and happiness and fear all at once as I did when I saw 2 pink lines.
 
My husband was ecstatic which surprised me but lessened some of my fears. I've wanted to try for a baby for years but I left the timeline up to him as to when to start trying to build our family. He immediately wanted to tell our family and friends. I was hesitant but agreed seeing as he told his boss so that he could come home and hug me. My dad was hesitant to congratulate only because I am high risk with multiple health conditions(I talked to doctors prior to trying to get the all clear) but overall everyone was excited for us. Those were my happiest and scariest 3 weeks.

This past week, I started spotting almost immediately after I got to work. I of course panicked and started crying but tried to convince myself everything was okay. I was trying to keep it together as my coworker and his wife had just had a miscarriage and I didn't want to be insensitive to him. He could tell immediately something was wrong with me. I told him what was happening and he tried to reassure me that spotting was normal but agreed if it got any worse I should go home immediately. Within 3 hours I was seeing clots and left work. My husband kept saying I was overreacting(he was trying to stay hopeful) However he took me to the ER where we were given mixed information from the doctors. Honestly to have no hope to having hope to it being ripped away almost dropped me.

The next day I had a ""prenatal"" appointment with one of my specialists that we had to go to. Having him congratulate me to telling him what happened broke my heart. But he reassured me that I was not alone and that i was still healthy enough to try again. 

Since then i have only broken down a couple times. My husband is all about moving forward and putting this behind us. I have tried to keep myself active and not thinking about it. The hardest I cried was the other night when I passed it. I looked for any friends who might be online and asked to call one. She talked me off the ledge and we changed the subject. Otherwise I haven't really been able to bring myself to acknowledge it. I just know I'm not sleeping well. Maybe 2-3 hours a day.

I go back to work at the end of this week. Only a few of my coworkers and bosses knew I was pregnant. I told my bosses and my one coworker(the one I was working with that night) about the miscarriage. I am almost praying he told the dayshift guys about it because I am scared I will break down completely. At the same time I'm scared that I won't. I feel like I'm not coping with this properly",t3_hqv8ad
1666,Miscarriage,"Wife and I just got news that our unborn (17 weeks) is most likely not going to be viable due to renal agenesis (no kidneys). Since we have a bit if of warning, is there any advice that will help us prepare?",t3_hqn5f7

1668,Miscarriage,"Hi All: Partial vent/information gathering post here. After an incomplete D&amp;C for a MMC I've been given two rounds of Misoprostal (Friday, and again today) to pass the remaining 1.5cm blood clot they keep seeing on the ultrasound. My body seems to be immune to this drug  😑 

Both times pills were placed vaginally as the Dr. said this would be more likely to work. I'm nearly on hour 7 for the second dose and nada. They told me if nothing happens by noon tomorrow, they will need to schedule a repeat D&amp;C. **Does anyone have positive stories to share about repeat D&amp;C's?** I'm mostly just fed up/annoyed at this point but I am scared to have a repeat D&amp;C so soon after the first (Ashermann's/anesthesia/etc). I know all these complications are very rare but it seems like I keep ending up in the tiny percentages for every part of this pregnancy and am not feeling particularly optimistic. Thank you.",t3_hquyh0
1669,Miscarriage,"I went to the hospital about a week after taking a pregnancy test for excessive puking/unable to hold anything down. No one talked to me about anything besides meds, IVs (ended up having 2 IVs and double dose of the nausea meds before release), blood tests, and an ultrasound. During ultra sound, they found a cyst 2cm. I was pretty shell shocked with the actual fact I was pregnant again and cyst. During the week, called resources and such to get a handle on just trying to keep anything down since meds wore off and could keep any of the tablet nausea meds. Also just could shake a weird feeling something was a miss. During an appointment I had to apply for pregnancy Medicaid, I was looking for the estimated length of time of how far I was. Clocked at 5 weeks and a few days but the notes section struck me. ""Possible ectopic pregnancy, threatened miscarriage."" Had copper IUD removed, it punctured / was embedded. (Long story short, reaction made me have it removed. Lost insurance before follow up, got a new plan and scheduled for testing. Pandemic hit and cancelled my appointments since my doctor decided to take a leave.)

I've been to the hospital another 3 times for dehydration/puking. Same thing in notes. Last period would make me 12 weeks. I haven't had a similar ultrasound that fits time line for how far along. Last one was calculated at 6 weeks, 1 day. I had some obnoxious pulsing pain in my back about a month ago and could barely stand. Lasted about a day and a half. Tried going to ER but refused. Was a weekend and I couldn't get anyone to watch my daughter so I toughed it out.  Was on par with fake contractions I had during my daughter's pregnancy. I've learned I'm violently sick if I eat chicken, pork, glutton, dairy, and such. I do know my cyst is at 3.1cm now. Progressively getting weaker. Have had mentions of strong possibility of it being stillborn. But nothing further. 


I'm so confused and lost, angry and just feel defeated. I know if I don't get answers from doctors, I'll just go to the routine of abort. But it doesn't seem normal, there's something off and I can't put my finger on it with the whole thing.  How did you guys know if you did before doctors? Anything would help. I can't shake thing so I figured I post and see outside perspective.",t3_hqrc5z
1670,Miscarriage,"I'm currently experiencing what I'm certain is my second chemical pregnancy at 4+1. Getting betas today but they'll be low as my FRER line which was there yesterday at 14dpo is almost gone, exactly like my last chemical. I only got barely-there squinters on 25 hcg threshold internet cheapies both cycles too. I had some hope this time as I had stronger symptoms, but it's all just gone so quickly.

I just feel like this process is a joke. This is my second cycle trying for a baby- both times were chemicals. I have Hashimoto's and PCOS, but since my TSH and thyroid are fine and for the moment I'm ovulating regularly (13/14dpo + 11-day luteal phase) I feel like things should be okay. I know this could still be chance but it just feels very cruel.

I know it's unlikely any doctor will do anything for 2 chemicals, but should I be advocating for anything? I will ask for a re-test of my TSH/T4 just in case things have changed there.",t3_hqfjah

1672,Miscarriage,"Hello everyone. 
I’ll keep this short but I need to vent it out. 

I found out I had a miscarriage during our first ultrasound at 7w4d when the baby had no heartbeat. 
I started taking the pills to miscarry and that was absolute hell. I had a visit 4 days later to confirm the miscarriage and unfortunately it didn’t work. I had a D&amp;C on Friday and I started to bleed last night. I’m not saturating the pads but I am bleeding. My anxiety has been so high and I just want this all to be over. I keep crying constantly. 
Someone tell me there is an end to this :(",t3_hql6ih
1673,Miscarriage,Last week at my 7w u/s they found a gestational sac measuring around 16mm with no yolk sac or fetal pole. So they suspected a blighted ovum. Today I went back for a 8w scan and they found a fetal pole measuring 4-5mm (which they said is very small) and no heartbeat. So they are still suspecting a miscarriage. I’m so confused about how things are still developing but not at the right timeline. Has this happened to anyone where they measuring 1-2 weeks behind? They want to schedule a D&amp;C but I want to scan again in a week before scheduling. Am I grasping at straws here?,t3_hqiffb
1674,Miscarriage,I had my d&amp;c on 6/14. Will my period go back to the normal date before pregancy?  Or will it cycle through on its own.

It only comes out when I'm alone and I'm afraid to talk about it in detail with my gf because I don't want to tear her down. We do NOT ignore it, but do move onto another topic soon after.. My family all knew and were very excited and were supportive initially. Now I feel alone because I feel like I missed my opportunity to feel so broken. I dont know what I'm asking for here exactly. I just miss my baby.",t3_hq4cnb
1679,Miscarriage,"I had a miscarriage on June 26th. I found out before I had a missed period - we were trying. From about 2 weeks after I found out I was pregnant, I didn't feel right. I was not able to get excited. I even told my husband I didn't feel like this was really going to happen. I was closely tracking everything.

At 9 weeks 3 days I started spotting. It was old blood but I already knew. It was a Saturday. Monday I called my doctor's office and they got me in that day for an ultrasound. The tech said 8 weeks 5 days but the heartbeat was fine and it even wiggled. I went in to talk to the midwife and had another ultrasound 2 days later and again no concerns. So I just figured I was wrong.

I spotted old blood consistently for 12 days. Then it got worse. I had discomfort and what I now know were contractions. I tried to sleep and woke up at midnight in pain. I went to the bathroom and saw large clots. My husband took me to the hospital and had to wait outside while I went in. There was blood everywhere when they did the initial pelvic exam. I had an ultrasound (transvaginal of course because why make this easier?) and the tech couldn't give me the results but she knew that I knew. She gave me a box of tissues and said she's sorry before wheeling me back to the room. Once the doctor came in to tell me there was no heartbeat they let my husband come in. The midwife, that magical little fairy, she said my uterus was healthy and she'll see me again next pregnancy. I knew she meant for a successful delivery. 

I was given miso and by 5am, 15 minutes after I started dissolving it in my cheeks, I passed the placenta. It looked like a deflated red sack. I really have no idea but I felt like the embryo was in there. I can still feel it happening like it was an hour ago. 3 days after I miscarried, I had an ultrasound that determined everything had passed.

I lived in hell for about a week and could only cry. I became consumed in my grief. I've experienced deeply painful and traumatic events before, but this was worse. I'm so scared it will happen again. My husband's ex wife had a mc and then had a baby with someone else after they divorced. I may have had one around 3 years ago, I'm really not sure. His sperm motility is very slightly below average and he is asking for additional testing. 

I have been journaling and watching YouTube videos and googling trying to gain hope again. I have a story that I read to myself about my next baby and I have small phrases I collected that I thought were helpful. Honestly though I'm having so much trouble moving forward. There were so many amazing things I was looking forward to and now they are just gone. I feel like I don't have a purpose and I still spend a lot of my day crying. I want to feel good and happy again and I just can't.

I also feel like it's my fault and I kind of hope it was because I've made changes. I smoked weed until I got a positive test. I started again after the mc but I've since completely quit. I was not eating healthy at all during my pregnancy and have since changed my diet, for depression and future pregnancy. I exercise 30-60 minutes 6-7 days per week. I was so stressed by covid and racial oppression (I live in the U.S.) that I could feel it in my body. It didn't help that I was newly sober and unable to take my antidepressant because of the pregnancy.

I worry that my stress and this new stress and depression will cause me to miscarry again. I know that my chances are statistically better if we try again sooner. It's so hard to hope and to envision a healthy baby and a family for myself. Even if I can only have one baby, that will be enough for me. If you have read this entire post, I sincerely thank you. I need to get this out and I need to hope again.",t3_hq1jqo
1680,Miscarriage,"I started writing poetry again after my miscarriage at the end of May. Thought I would start sharing on here so we all know we aren't alone and many of us feel the exact same away. 

Loss

I go through the day plastering on a smile, sometimes it works
Trying not to think about you, the loss
Sometimes I laugh and don't feel so empty
Then it hits like a tidal wave of sorrow
A heaviness in my chest that won't pass 
Tears burning my eyes
At times I can distract myself 
Pretending I'm in calm water, until the next wave crashes
I miss you 
I wish I still had you",t3_hq3to1
1681,Miscarriage,"I miscarried on 7/5. I was supposed to be exactly 8 weeks, but my baby never grew beyond 5 weeks.I have come to the decision that I need to give them a name. Trying to find the right name has been very different from when my husband and I were talking about what to name them before we knew they would never join us in this life. He is trying to be supportive, but admitted he finds it strange to give them a name. We have talked, and I think he understands why I want to do this, but he still doesn’t feel this loss like I do. He is agreeable to the name I think I want to go with, but that’s because he wants to make me happy again, and not because he is invested in this decision. Does he just need more time? Will I be naming our child on my own? 
Also, the name I am considering is Genesis. I don’t know if my baby was a boy or girl, and this feels like a name that could go either way. I strongly associate this name with first, and they are always going to be my first child. It means beginning, which is all they ever were, a beginning.

Update: Thank you everyone for sharing your experiences. I feel a lot better about giving my baby a name, even if my husband doesn’t feel as strongly about it as I do. My child is named Genesis. They will always be my first.",t3_hpxjn6
1682,Miscarriage,"I had a MMC in March. I was supposed to be 10 weeks but the ultrasound showed a baby at 6 weeks 4 days and no heartbeat. I had to take the Miso(I think) pill to end it. It was EXTREMELY traumatic and it took me a bit to get over. We started trying again in May once I got the ""ok"" from my doctor. I got pregnant again and this time my doctor sent me for an early US because of the previous miscarriage. The baby was measuring great, but the heartbeat was very low. I was measuring 6 weeks and a few days and the baby had a bpm of 60. So I was scheduled to come in a week later. Sure enough, this past Friday I found out that the baby's heart stopped. We are devastated. Two right in a row. I don't know what to do next. Do I ask for testing? Do we just try again and hope? I don't know if I can go through this heartache again.",t3_hq777w

I’m relieved that I can move forward and glad to feel like myself again, but also so sad of what I lost. This is my second MMC in a row so I am being referred to an RE to hopefully find some answers.",t3_hq3q4b
1684,Miscarriage,"Context: 

UCSF is running a study on COVID and pregnancy. I signed up with my last pregnancy. As part of the study you have to lancet your finger(s) once a week to give them your blood for antibody testing. After you miscarry they ask you to finish out the first trimester blood collection (ugh, fine). I miscarried at the end of June and have one more week of blood collection to go.

Observation:
When I first started collecting blood I had SUCH a hard time - like we're talking 4-5 lancets to get five little blood spots. It was impossible to really get the blood to form a full drop on my finger. I read all the things online, went for a walk, took a shower, put pressure on my finger and arm.. and got it down to three lancets. But it was still an ORDEAL.

THEN... I had the miscarriage and suddenly it got a LOT easier.

Right away I was easily done with two lancets, and then this week (~2wks after MC) I did it with one lancet easily and had to put a bit of pressure on my finger to get it to STOP bleeding.

I knew pregnancy changed a lot about your body, but it's kind of blown my mind how much more easily I bleed now. 🤯

Questions:
1. Is anyone else in this same situation with Aspire? How has it been for you?  

2. Is anyone aware of a good resource on blood changes and pregnancy written for someone who hasn't studied blood? I'm so curious about this but my googling has led me nowhere. 😞",t3_hq8boy

1688,Miscarriage,"Hello, I should be 9w today. At just under 7 weeks an ultrasound discovered a gestation of less than 5 weeks. Follow up about a week and a half later found no growth, so my family doctor diagnosed a MMC. I'm waiting to hear from my OB about next steps since it doesn't seem to be passing naturally. The thing is that I'm still having nausea, food aversions, and sore breasts. 

I had a MMC in October that was discovered at 10w after an earlier ultrasound with heartbeat. For that one my symptoms had abated by the 10w ultrasound. I had a D&amp;C.

I'm so confused as why a pregnancy that didn't develop as far as my first is causing more intense symptoms? Is having symptoms a sign that this won't pass naturally? Is it possible to pass while hormones are high enough to trigger symptoms?

I am nervous about the risks of a second D&amp;C but dealing with the symptoms knowing there is no possibility of a baby at the end of this is really difficult emotionally.",t3_hpvr2a

1690,Miscarriage,"I’m definitely venting a bit here, too, because the past week has, in a word, been hell—I’ve been dealing with a terrifying amount of blood and tissue. My OB’s office rescheduled my miscarriage follow up appointment AND forgot to cancel my scheduled ultrasound despite me asking them to, so it was a not-so-fun surprise when I got the confirmation call for my 8 week U/S and checkup. I’m really not excited about going to an office that I know will have a waiting room full of pregnant ladies, but it is what it is.

Still getting over the July 4th holiday when I had to put on a happy face while screaming internally, bleeding through a worrisome number of pads, and leaving every other hour to bawl my eyes out in a hot, 101 degree car. SIL with one toddler and one infant are staying with us (long story short: she and her kids are immunocompromised, and when her husband began to work a high-risk job, she tested negative and asked to wait out the rest of the pandemic at my house), and even though my husband let her know what has happened, she keeps asking me what I think about nursing/weening and telling me how good my husband is with her toddler and infant. I think she thinks it’s helping/therapeutic?

The problem I’m facing is that I can’t bring myself to tell her that seeing her children and watching my husband play and laugh with them isn’t helping me at all (cue the internal screaming). I don’t like to wear myself on my sleeve, but my husband was so shocked/excited when we found out I was pregnant, he practically shouted it from the rooftops—now he has to tell everyone at his office, his friends, his family, all of them that it didn’t work out whereas I only told my mom about the pregnancy and the MC because I knew that losing the pregnancy was possible (and in this case, inevitable).

Now, I’m dealing with a mixture of being coddled, ignored, and flat out insulted by the people who know and are reacting to me, the pitiful lady who miscarried. I feel like I have a scarlet “MC” on my chest whenever I talk to my in-laws, run into my husband’s coworkers, etc. It’s awful. I don’t want to hear about how someone’s cousin had a MC ten years ago. I don’t want to hear that it means I’m more “fertile” or it probably won’t happen again next time. And, FFS, I sure as hell don’t want to hear you say, “He’s just so amazing with little ones” while my husband rocks your infant to sleep.

So I’m left wondering how you have dealt with people and the social aftermath of a MC. I’ve been slacking off at work, too, but don’t know if/how to tell my boss, who just started working for the company three weeks ago to top it off. Any help?

TLDR: It sucks dealing with people who know you are going through a MC, especially when they’re reacting in the worst ways possible. It also sucks when you should tell someone for your own mental and physical health’s sake (ie: your boss) and don’t know how. What are your experiences and how did you handle them?

Does it ever get easier? Please tell me it gets easier.",t3_hpzipn
1691,Miscarriage,"Hello y’all. 
I am sorry if anything is too detailed, I’m getting desperate at this point... 
A little back story. I started having what I thought were “pregnancy signs” (peeing more, being nauseous, sore boobs, which I had never had before, things like that.) a little more then a month ago, but I ruled it out as the test was negative. Two weeks ago I started feeling really nauseous and sick, it got to the point where I missed a few days of work as I didn’t want to get worse. At this point my period was over a week late, but I didn’t want to think too much of it since the test was negative. Fast forward to the 3rd of July and I get what I think is my period, it seemed different then a normal one. That night I started getting really bad cramps, ones unlike the normal period cramps. I had to have my husband help me in bed, but I shrugged it off and went to work the next day. On the 4th I started having even worse cramps, with an added headache, back pain and was really nauseous. I went home early from work and was walking slowly as it hurt too much to go at my normal speed. I went to sleep that night with preparation for a normal period, but was awoken at about 3am to being in a little pool of blood. 
I went to the bathroom and took my tampon out to see a small fleshy thing on the end of it, it wasn’t a clot. It is very common for me to have clots, and that was %100 not one. 
I got up the next day still slightly cramping but not bleeding anymore, so my husband and I think I may have had a miscarriage. 
The day after I stopped bleeding I started bleeding again, but only a little, very different then any other period. I have been to the doctors they said since the test was negative I wasn’t pregnant, but I’m on day 8 now and I’m still cramping like a period, and slightly passing blood.

it would have been our first baby, I am just trying to figure out if that’s what happened.

1692,Miscarriage,"My first loss was at 4w5d. I knew it was doomed from the first positive test. I wasn’t attached to that pregnancy at all despite having tried for 3 years prior to it.

2 years later I finally got pregnant from IVF. That baby passed away at 10w gestation. 

Tonight I just passed what would’ve been IVF baby 2 at 6w3d. 

A week ago I had slight bleeding that turned into brown spotting. I wasn’t worried - with my 10w loss I had a SCH, which are common with IVF. Today I started cramping... and then bleeding brown blood. The blood turned red, which then gave way to worse cramps. Clots followed. I passed the gestational sac, which pulled me into reality - this was a miscarriage, not a SCH like I hoped. I’m still having bleeding and terrible cramps hours after losing the sac. I can’t sleep through the contractions. This one isn’t as difficult as my 10w loss but I’m freaking angry and sad that I can’t keep a baby. 

Im grateful my body recognized this and is taking care of it on its own. I’m grateful I have 12 more embryos frozen and waiting on me. I’m just not sure how to move forward from here.",t3_hpq6qj
1693,Miscarriage,"After we found out about our MMC 3 weeks ago me and my wife have just been on a rollercoaster of emotions. Some days we feel ok, sometimes really depressed but we’re just taking it one day at a time. The messages of support we got on here after it happened really helped so thank you for that.

I just wanted to know what other people’s experiences were with late MMCs. We found out about ours at the 20 week scan and found that the baby had passed on at 15 weeks. So far we haven’t gotten any answers but we have the following info:

- The baby had been a boy, developing well and had no obvious genetic issues and appeared healthy. We are still waiting on the post-mortem results though.

- They confirmed it wasn’t caused by an infection and none of the swabs came back positive for this. Also her 16 week blood test was negative on all STIs.

- When the baby was delivered they had a great deal of trouble getting the placenta to detach, which meant that my wife needed to go to theatre. The doctor mentioned it was quite fibrous and it might be behind what happened.

What has peoples experiences with this been? Did you ever find out what happened to cause the MMC? I think we are just very anxious to look for as much help as we can to make sure this doesn’t happen again.",t3_hpqxlb

The spotting started at 6 weeks and I called the doctor right away. He wanted to wait till 7 weeks for an ultrasound. I tried to maintain hope as the spotting continued and became heavier. Every time I used the bathroom I felt paralyzed by anxiety. My sister, mother, and partner all did their best to reassure me it would be okay. But I felt like I just knew in my gut.

The morning of my ultrasound (July 6th) I was standing in the kitchen with my boyfriend and blood started gushing down my leg. I ran to toilet and just sobbed. I knew. 

I cried all the way to the doctor's as my boyfriend drove. The hardest part was sitting in the waiting room with all the other pregnant women and their large bellies as I continued to cry. 

The ultrasound confirmed my worst fears. There was nothing in my uterus, the tissue had already passed. I've continued to bleed this entire week, each time I see blood fills me with pain and heartbreak.

I want to be done bleeding.

This is so incredibly hard.

1703,Miscarriage,"Trigger Warning: 2nd MC, abandonment 

About a month ago I was having intense pregnancy symptoms, but because I’ve had other issues with my uterus because of cysts and some other health issues, I wasn’t sure. My boyfriend swore up and down I was pregnant. Because of COVID, we’ve been getting into a lot more arguments over the last couple months, but we always ended with making up. Always, always, always. The pregnancy possibility put more tension into the mix, as we both recently lost our jobs due to the pandemic and we’ve both been under a lot of stress. 

I miscarried a year and a half ago, with my ex boyfriend. For context, it was not a healthy relationship, and That same week I miscarried (my first MC), he broke up with me. It was one of the most traumatic things I’ve experienced, and it messed me up a lot. I met my boyfriend 6 months later, and we’ve been together a few weeks shy of a year. It has been the healthiest, best relationship I’ve been in with the most wonderful man I’ve ever met. He wants children, a family with me, he’s honest and caring and we worked together to actively build our relationship. But, things were tense with the results of this pandemic, and we were fighting a lot (as I’m sure many of you have experienced haha).

I took a two pregnancy tests a few weeks ago. One was positive, one was negative, and I was certain I was pregnant. We were stressed because we are both young and without jobs (furloughed since the start of the pandemic), and the day I found out we fought and were on the verge of breaking up (of my accord, which was not right of me and I apologized for it), and then I explained to him I was spiraling out because I was terrified, and told him about the pregnancy tests. We made up, he said he loved me, and he was with me, pregnancy or not. A week later I finally got in to see the doctor, and the blood test came back as no longer pregnant. The assumption was that I miscarried (my 2nd MC). I don’t think my boyfriend understood that, and I didn’t know how to explain things. I’ve been so anxious and torn up the last couple weeks, and we’ve continued to have a couple more fights (with my anxiety and lack of communication on that end not helping the situation). 

Monday seemed to be the last straw, but I’m not sure what happened. He has felt so overwhelmed with everything going on, and Monday he ignored me all day, then showed up at my place and sobbed and said he couldn’t be in this relationship anymore, that he can’t do this anymore. I asked for him to talk with me about this, because it came out of left field and I was very confused as we had just the day before had a good time, and talked about our lives together. We were communicating better the issues we were having, and things seemed to be on the right track. And then, the next day, he ended it with no reasoning, nothing. Just dropped off something I bought him “because it was expensive” and sobbed at my front door for 20 minutes, and wouldn’t stop hugging me and holding my hands, then left. 

Since the MC, and the cysts and everything else I’m dealing with, this week I ended up in the ER (2 days after the breakup). They got me into a gynecology appointment in a couple of days. It’s been a humbling week, and i’m afraid that with the issues going on that I could need surgery to remove either my cysts, or possibly the ovaries as well. Today I decided to text my boyfriend and ask if he has a chance to talk next week, but I haven’t gotten a response yet.

I’m mourning the loss of this MC, I’m in so much physical pain with everything going on in with my body, and I’m scared that things are worse than I thought and I will not be able to have children at all. The worst part of all of this is in my gut I feel like my boyfriend got overwhelmed and we’ll stay together, but I’m not sure. Most of all, I’m so incredibly heartbroken he’s not here with me through this. I’m heartbroken I’m mourning our child alone (despite not being far along), mourning the fact I’ve had two MCs at 23, and I’m trying to grapple with the fact that I may have to mourn this relationship as well if he’s not the man I know he’s been.

1704,Miscarriage,"I had a miscarriage on June 5th. As much as I wanted to get pregnant right away I don’t think that’s happening. Every post, blog and internet article I’ve read said that the first period after a miscarriage is pretty painful and not like a normal period.

Anyone else have a super light period after a miscarriage?",t3_hp0203
1705,Miscarriage,"TW// descriptive/graphic

I have been TTC since January. In March, I thought I was going through a MC. I was so sure. I called a health line and talked with them and they couldn’t confirm if it was or not. Turns out, just an early period. 

The last four months, I’ve been working from home and it’s been VERY challenging. My mental health declined rapidly, my stress levels were beyond manageable, I didn’t get any support from my management. It was so hard. But, finally, I got to go back to work, in person, with my coworkers. FINALLY, light at the end of my dark tunnel. 

I started my period of Friday, July 3rd. My cycle has been SO irregular because of my stress levels, but my periods had been pain free and very light. This period was accompanied by contraction like cramps on day 1 and 2. So bad I thought of going to the emergency because I kept thinking to myself “what if I’m pregnant and didn’t know?” I literally felt like I was in labour. But then the pain went away. I was still bleeding heavily though. Just assumed it was a heavy period and my body was just shedding more than usual. 

Monday, July 6th, I went to work, in person, with my coworkers for the first time in 4 months. I was so happy to be back. I was still bleeding very heavily but was pain free. No biggy. 

Within the hour of getting home after my 8 hour shift, I felt a gush of liquid. I had bled through my pants SO much in about 1 minute time. It felt like a murder scene. I ran to the bathroom and sat on the toilet. 

I was stuck there for 3 hours while my body pushed out tissue, LARGE clots, and so much blood. I just sat there in disbelief. I was so shocked. What was coming out of my body felt so unnatural. So wrong. I genuinely felt like I was experiencing an out of body experience. Right away, I knew what was happening. The contraction-like cramps made sense now. The heavy bleeding too. 

But, I had NO IDEA that a MC was like this. I didn’t know this is what it looked like/felt like. I know everyone’s experience is different and I thought I knew what to expect should it ever happen, but I was dead wrong. 

I didn’t know I was pregnant. That made this MC “easier” in some ways, but so traumatizing nonetheless. 

I called my doctor first thing in the morning and he sent me for blood work right away. Thankfully, everything came back perfect and he confirmed that I was having what he called an “instant abortion”, the egg implanted and essentially unstuck right away. He said that this is unfortunately common in first time pregnancies, but that most women that have a miscarriage during their first pregnancies go on to have perfectly healthy pregnancies and babies the second time around. I’m really crossing all my fingers and toes that this is my case. 

My bleeding lasted 7 full days. I experienced three separate “episodes” of consistent tissue and clot discharging. 

My doctor said that since my body did it’s thing properly, that I stopped the discharging and bleeding within 7 days with no more pain and that I wouldn’t need a D&amp;C and that we “no longer had to follow this” 

I’m eager to move on from this. This was so much harder than I could have ever imagined. Nothing prepares you for this. I felt so mad at myself and my body for failing us, but I am trying to shift my perspective and just tell myself that my body is preparing us for our next healthy pregnancy. My body and I got this. We will be okay. We will get pregnant again. We will have our baby. We will grow our family. My body is a safe place for me and my babies.",t3_horvni
1706,Miscarriage,"My 7 week scan was not promising and now my 8week scan is doomed (too tiny with super low heart beat that can't even be measured).

1707,Miscarriage,"Hello,
 I have a small question. I've talked to my PCP about this but I wanted everyone else's opinion also. 
I feel like I'm bruising a lot easier after my miscarriage. I'm covered in them. I'm of the snow white brand of Caucasian and I know I show bruises easy, but I feel this is excessive. I have bruises on my forearm, shins, thighs, stomach, hip. I don't recall anything to cause them, only one I can explain. I checked with my primary doctor and he says there's nothing wrong and suggests I might be more aware of them now. I only had routine bloodwork done and everything is within normal limits. 
Has anyone experienced this at all? I keep coming back to how this started after the miscarriage and I wonder if something is wrong. For reference I had a miscarriage end of april, chemical end of June. 
Thanks for any feedback!",t3_hozmly

Fast forward to today, I bled but it was nothing like a period. But I did have to pull something out but I’m not sure if it’s a miscarriage as there’s no blood still.

But just like that, worry took over when the bleeding started. 

Now here I am losing my first baby. One minute I feel like I will be ok and another I burst into tears. My cramps are beginning to intensify and the bleeding is picking up.

This hurts SO badly. Looking at my mother with my siblings, or aunts with cousins, even grandparents. They’ve all had successful pregnancies. It’s just not fair. I’m filled with anger when I see them and I’ve avoided them and all family events.

My ex announced earlier this week that him and his girlfriend are expecting. My friend saw it fit to send it to me - totally forgetting about my miscarriage. This hurt so badly.

1717,Miscarriage,"I had a MC followed by a DandC two weeks ago. I’ve been coping better than expected - the procedure went well and I was never really emotionally attached since I knew my HCG slowed pretty early on. Had some good crying sessions, but tried to stay strong and optimistic about the future. 

I have lean PCOS and am anovulatory, so it’s been a bit of a roller coaster for me for the past few months - I didn’t expect to get pregnant so quickly (TI with the help of femara, dexamethosone + trigger on my second try). This was my first pregnancy, and as quickly as it happened, it was all taken away within a month. 

Back when I was about 6.5 weeks, my fertility doc sent the referral in to the obgyn at the hospital. At that point, we had a heartbeat but the gestational sac was measuring very small. Combined with low and slow HCG, my gut knew it wasn’t going to end well, but nonetheless she sent it in. 

Fast forward to yesterday: I’m getting ready to call the fertility clinic to book my follow up and finally start over, when I get a voicemail from the obgyn at the hospital to book my 12 week ultrasound! I was like WTF... did the clinic not follow up with them? I called them back and left them a voicemail explaining I unfortunately no longer needed the appointments, but I was a bit weirded out that they weren’t notified. 

This morning I just got a call from the receptionist at my fertility clinic confirming if the obgyn’s office called me! I was almost in shock at the lack of communication - I had to reiterate my situation yet again. Granted, she was very apologetic, but I don’t get how the same office that told me there was no heartbeat and referred me to the hospital for a DandC somehow forgot that it all happened. 

Ugh. Just needed to vent. I know it’s human error, it just sucks to feel like it’s done and I’m ready to move forward, just to have these phone calls trigger me. I’ll get over it I just wish they had their shit together.

I found out from my doctor on Monday that my HCG levels were dropping and I was miscarrying and quickly told my best friend. We have been friends for 20+ years, she was the maid of honor at my wedding and I will be hers. We have been through a lot together but she has a tendency to keep her feelings and emotions to herself unless I open up a conversation about it. Even if I do get her talking, she is clearly u comfortable. Now I know this about my friend, but the fact that she hasn’t reached out to me since Monday to check in on me? That just feels like being a shitty friend to me. I understand that people don’t always know what to say and maybe want to give you space, but not even a hey how are you text?

So I guess my question is, is there a way for me to approach that I feel like she’s being unsupportive in a gentle way? Or am I expecting too much? Maybe I should wait until I’m not so heated about it but it’s just really hurtful. Any advice would be appreciated.",t3_hoqb3c
1719,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone - I had a D&amp;C on May 1 (so, it's been approx 9.5 weeks). I was 8 weeks at the time of the D&amp;C with an HCG around 50k.  Two weeks later my HCG dropped to around 200 and since then it has been very (VERY) slowly dropping. My RE monitors my levels once per week and he won't let me start another FET transfer cycle until I am below 2.  So, this past Monday (7/6) I was at 2.48 and today I am at 2.26.  Before this week, it was basically dropping by half every week.  My RE is going to do an ultrasound this Tuesday.  Has anyone ever experienced such a low drop towards the end?  Is there a chance I could have retained tissue with such low numbers?  Also, I should mention that I had two periods since the D&amp;C, on June 1 (just a day or so of bleeding, mostly brown) and July 1 (more like a normal period).

I’m on Depo Provera and I have been on it for 11 months. Every three months they also give me a pregnancy test when they give me my shot.

My last shot was may 20th and I wasn’t pregnant.

On June 22nd I started having really sharp pain in my lower stomach just above my vagina and also where my ovaries are. 

Then I started bleeding heavily for about 15 minutes and some blood clots and pieces of bodily tissue came out. The chunks of tissue weren’t too big, I’d say about two inches by two inches. And there were two pieces that came out.

I’ve been having the sharp pains still off and on but never as bad as that day. That day I cried in pain and fear and even was about to go to the hospital because it was so bad and very abnormal for me.

I am going to be getting a trans vaginal ultrasound soon but I’m not sure if they’d be able to tell me if I was ever pregnant.

But sitting here thinking back, for a week or so before I bled I had a strong sense of smell, and sensitive boobs. I also had thoughts of being pregnant (I ignored them because before being on depo I used to have bad anxiety to the point where my body would start having symptoms)

I've been tweaking my diet and supplements but no luck yet and at least for now I feel like the doctor would be a waste of time. I wish I could hit the reset button.",t3_hoquiu
1723,Miscarriage,"So glad for this community during this shitty time. So my last period was in April, I found out I was pregnant on Mother’s Day, and lost the baby in early June. I just got my first period since my miscarriage and I’m experiencing a few things and I’m hoping I’m not alone. 

1) I’m having a lot of discomfort using tampons right now. Has this happened with anyone else? 

2) I’m feeling super emotional today getting my period as this is another physical reminder of my loss.",t3_hofexm
1724,Miscarriage,"I’m in this weird state four weeks post miscarriage where i don’t know if I’m about to ovulate, already ovulated, or currently ovulating. I had what my doctor THOUGHT was my period about 8 days after the miscarriage, then had my normal ovulation symptoms about 13 days later. Now those same feelings are back. I’m so confused. I think my body is confused. I just want to get pregnant again.",t3_hoio6w
1725,Miscarriage,"I found out the baby's heart beat stopped last week at 8 weeks. My doctor prescribed misoprostol and I was crying at the appt. so he didnt go into much detail of what to expect. I am now just wondering about what to expect such as how bad is the cramping (he prescribed acetaminophen/codeine too), will I be able to go to work the next day, will my husband need to help me with anything, etc. If anyone could share I would really appreciate it.

Edit: Thank you everyone for sharing your experiences! I feel so much better prepared now because my doctor didnt relay any of this to me. Virtual hugs to you all.",t3_hog0bl
1726,Miscarriage,"Warning - this is a graphic and long

So, I want to make this post because I find that talking about issues I am dealing with really helps me to process and normalize things like trauma and hard emotional events.  I am not sure if I will be able to go into detail about what happened with friends as it was very traumatic and gruesome, I even had a friend ask me 'how did you find out' that I had miscarried, there was no finding out as it was spontaneous. This was my first pregnancy.

it happened on Tuesday after I spent Saturday-Monday feeling off, lethargic with a light headache. I have the summer off from teaching so I didn't have any responsibilities to worry about. I had been spotting a rusty red/brown discharge off and on the entire pregnancy and was told this was normal, I even went to my first ultrasound at 8 weeks and saw a normal embryo with a normal heartbeat. Monday night I noticed I had doubled the amount of usual discharge and it had turned dark brown and eventually into red. There was not a lot, but it was there when I wiped and I had none overnight, I was worried but figured it could also be normal? I called my doctor in the morning and she said this could be a miscarriage or it could be something else and part of a healthy pregnancy, the only way to know for certain is to get an ultrasound. I was due my NT soon anyway.

Then shit really hit the fan a few hours later. I was on the phone to try and book the ultrasound (they couldn't see me for at least a week) when I felt a rush of liquid, water leave my body. I ended the call and ran to the washroom and sat on the toilet when another rush of water suddenly poured out of me. This is the hardest part, I saw the fetus drop out of my body, into the tank. It horrified me, it disgusted me and I was scared. I didn't even pull my pants up and ran out of the bathroom to tell my husband he had to come help right now, he was on a work conference call at the time. He came to me right away and I told him what happened. Neither of us knew what to do, it was so shocking.  He called his sister who is nurse to help us. 

I decided to go into our kitchen to dispose of what I had been wearing when I felt the most disgusting experience of my life. I felt something gush and drop out of me, it was red gelatin's ball the size of a tennis ball in my underwear. These large blood clots would continue to fall out of me for the next two hours, I hated every single time it happened. There was blood everywhere, all over our kitchen, all over our bathroom and I am so thankful my husband was there, he cleaned it all himself.  It was something from a horror movie. At one point I had gone to the washroom to deal with the clots, when I became suddenly hot and lightheaded, I took off all my clothes from the waist down and laid on the bathroom floor for about 20 minutes, hoping I would not have to go to a hospital. 

After the two hours the worst was over and I was just bleeding at a regular period level. I had a conversation with my midwife at some point as well, but I do not remember what we said, I just know that what was happening was considered normal and my husband was told what to look out for. It was a terrifying experience I was ready for, not at all prepared for. I expected just a lot of bleeding, not that I would see my baby ( I find that even weird to say) or that a ton of tissue would be expelled. I was not even in that much pain, my period cramps are 5x worse than what I felt-it just seems strange. 

I finally feel like myself again, I feel like a lot of the hormones have left and I am starting fresh again, I got a decent nights sleep and I talked to my therapist yesterday. I feel like it will take some time to really come to terms with this, and today is good day but that doesn't mean tomorrow will not suck. I know I will have a ton of anxiety when we choose to try again, as what I went through was horrible and traumatic. I don't think I can handle that again emotionally. I feel like I am mostly processing the trauma of the event and not even that I am losing out on a baby or a person I had a planned future with, I don't know if I will feel that later. I didn't allow myself to get too attached and I refused to fantasize about having a baby/family because I would afraid that this would happen. I wonder if that protected me in some way, or if I will find out it doesn't matter, you will mourn anyway?

It took us over an hour to decide to flush the toilet, I am still feeling weird about that decision. I could not look at it though, it was too much for me and it was too much for my husband. It felt very unceremonious, but it was too horrific to consider any other options.",t3_ho6wsm
1727,Miscarriage,"So I had my D&amp;C yesterday. Honestly it went really well. The whole OR staff was really kind. Right before my Dr came pre-op I started puking bad. They had just given me a bunch of meds on an empty stomach. And I still had morning sickness. They all rushed around me and made sure I had a cold cloth for my head. Rubbed my back and held my hair back. The Anesthesia dr gave me extra nausea meds in my iv. RN even used a numbing agent before giving me the iv so it wouldn’t hurt so bad. 

Post op the thing that hurts the most is the intubation from the ga. Had some painful cramping right after but they gave me Fentynal  and it went away soon. Other than that everything is mild if any cramping. I’m taking some blood meds to help prevent clots. But no pain meds yet. Idk if I’m still high from yesterday’s meds though. 

Haven’t really felt any sadness. I’m trying to see the positives and keep hope up. We ordered a genetic test so hopefully we’ll have results in 2 weeks. Dr said insurance doesn’t normally cover it after the first miscarriage. but we didn’t care. We didn’t want to “waste” the opportunity to learn from this experience if we have the means. 

We did learn my blood type will cause issues in the next pregnancy and I’ll need to take meds for that. I felt like that’s progress. Now I’m just trying to enjoy foods I couldn’t eat before like deli meat. 

I’m sure the sadness will hit. I will feel it as it comes and goes. My husband has been so helpful and kind (as he should be). He’s back at work today but is close by should I need him. My work has told me not to put work first and to take care of my emotional health. So I took a week off. We get 40 hours just for “Kin care” so I’m using that. I’ll try to go back Monday. 

All in all just posting to say I feel cared for at this moment. I’m thankful for this forum and reading y’alls stories. It helps me know what to expect. I’m thankful for my kind drs and medical staff. I’m thankful for my husband. I’m thankful for my pup. I don’t feel so alone. Praying for the best for all of us.",t3_ho2p25

1729,Miscarriage,"So tomorrow I am getting a tattoo for my miscarriage, I’ve decided to get mountains and a bird flying away from them. The mountains because I’m pretty sure I conceived while I was in Colorado hiking or shortly after, and bird obviously to represent baby. My question is, what color should I make the bird? I plan on adding more birds once we successfully have children and that first bird baby added would be rainbow. But for this one I can’t think of the color it should be. Any ideas would be helpful.

1732,Miscarriage,"This may be a little bit of a rant, but I need some insight from those of you who have been through this.

My work gave me 5 days of bereavement and then I used sick time for another 3 days. I felt completely unprepared to return to work, but what could I do? My boss has checked in every few days to see how I’m doing and I’ve been honest and told him that I am having a hard time focusing on work. He is confused because he says that, when he has dealt with grief, he actually prefers working because it helps him work through the grief. He can’t imagine taking more than a week or two off of work for it.

I told him that that’s not how it works for everyone. That many people need much longer to process. I feel like I need to have another conversation with him to give him some insight into how hard this has been. I’m honestly surprised I haven’t had a nervous breakdown at work. 

I am going on a 2 week furlough next week and so I don’t know if I should just wait to talk to him. It’s frustrating because he’s not going to fire me, but I still feel the need to inform him about why some people need time off instead of just jumping back into work.

Do you have any advice for me? What has the returning to work process been like for you?",t3_hodubl

1734,Miscarriage,"Hello!
First time using reddit. I'm 28 yrs. old and I lost my little girl at 25wks in April. (Not my 1st pregnancy. Messed up after high school and my mom found out. Said I couldn't keep it and took me straight to a doctor to have it aborted. I was 17 wks then. I've moved on and forgiven her.)

Anyway, my husband and I were excited to be starting a family. Everything was great and we seemingly got it made.  My husband was elated  as this was his first child. April 5th, I had excessive movements in the bottom of my cervix and didn't think much of it. Maybe I was just super excited that I'm feeling her move. Looking back i should've called my OB. April 7th, I woke feeling like I was on top of the world. Around 4pm I went to the bathroom and felt like a ball was about to fall out my vagina. I quickly laid on the floor and yelled for my husband. Our little girl had decided to see this world a bit early.(She was still in the sac) I didn't have the strength to cry. All I could think of was to not close my legs and wish her to go back in. I was taken to the hospital via ambulance with my legs elevated. About 10 minutes later, the bulge went in. Upon examination by my OB, he said my cervix was dilated. I was given the option to go home and wait to see what happen or do an emergency cerclage. My husband and I chose the cerclage. I was in surgery for over 3 hrs and had to be transfused. My OB said my cervix was completely dilated and he hardly could find any left to apply the sutures. Eventually he got it done and sent me home and placed me on complete bed rest.
For the following week I was in pain and barely could turn in bed. I had no appetite. My heart ached for my husband as he was trying to cope with everything and still be my everything. The one thing he always wanted, i was probably losing. 

April 14th I woke up with a temperature of 104°F and felt deathly. I told my husband to take me to the ER. By the time we got there, I was bleeding ( like a light period) and he called my OB. I was admitted. Then I had to do that dreaded, nose digging test for Covid 19. I cried. My husband was not allowed to stay with me or visit after he left. I cried harder. Darn Covid! I was placed on the surgical ward until the result came. I was in agony. Day 2 of being there, my body was shutting down, my veins kept rejecting my IVs and multiple blood was drawn for testing. I was placed on oxygen and then given 2 bags of blood. Again. Next day I was positive for Covid. I was quickly placed in isolation, then eventually moved to the respiratory unit, where they dealt with covid patients.

Due to constant pain and bleeding, my OB explained what I feared deep down. I was losing Elizabeth. My blood tests results, as per a nurse, said i had a blood infection. (Sepsis???) My OB had to remove the sutures as they were basically choking the swollen cervix. It was now a matter of waiting for my baby to come out. Because I had Covid, I had to stay in the hospital for 2 weeks. I was on a lot of medications for the infection. I did not even know what outside looked like. I only knew it had rained when the AC got colder. Now, no matter what dance I did or walking to ease my pain, my baby decided to stay in. My IV lines kept blowing out everyday and I was swollen, especially my legs and arms. A week later, I did an ultrasound which showed that the fluid surrounding her was slowly leaking. I was even more devastated.  My husband was so hurt he didn't know what to say to me at times. So many times we got our hopes up, especially when I heard her heartbeats, which was always around 150bpm. I did another ultrasound on the 28th, but the nurse would not say anything. In the evening when my OB visited, he said there was no fluid around my little girl. I felt so weak and helpless that I couldn't even respond to his questions.

On the morning of April 29th, my OB came in and said "" you have to have this baby this morning."" At 9.41 am, i pushed my little girl into this world. When the nurse brought her to me she explained that she didn't have long to survive as she was barely gasping for air. I cried like the world has ended. My husband was on video call and he broke.  I whispered sweet words to my little girl. I let her know how much she was loved from the very first day they told us our IVF was a success. She was perfect. Our little EVA. I sang to her, the nursery rhyme I made up. At 1045 am, she took her last gasp. My heart died then. I could not understand anything happening. Next I know, I was told I needed surgery as my placenta hadn't come out and the oxytocin wasn't flowing. I begged them not take away my baby, and to at least let her dad come see her. He was eventually given the green light to visit. I was whisked off to surgery while he was shown his daughter's body, by nurses. 

What was supposed to be at least an  hour surgery, turned to 3 hrs, as my placenta was glued to the walls of my uterus. My OB had to perform a D&amp;C to get it out. I was transfused again (2 bags) as I  had lost approximately 2L of blood. I was returned to the unit. Drugged and tired, I took up the body of my little girl ( my husband had left) hugged her close, kissed her and fell asleep with her in my arms. I was awoken by a nurse. It was time for me to release my little girl's body. ( I had signed some docs to have her cremated so I could lay her to rest on our property in CA). At 945 pm, I kissed her one final time and let her go. I wept.

My quarantine in the hospital ended. I was swabbed again and released on May 1st. I had to quarantine for another 2 wks or until my results came back. I didn't care. I had no zeal to even get out of bed, much less to go outside.I had just lost a piece of me. I had just lost my heart. I had lost the one true gift I promised my husband. I had lost our little girl. I blamed myself. I think I still do. If only I didn't do that abortion years ago. If only, if only, if only... she would be here. Even though I'm told no one knows why my cervix opened.
I have received her cremains in a little heart that was placed in a teddy bear. Everyday I hug that bear and think of our Elizabeth. Once borders are opened, hopefully we get the chance to go to Canada. I still cry for her. My heart aches. I yearn to be pregnant again. I have been cleared to go ahead. It just won't ever be the same. Yet she will always be etched on our hearts. We will never forget her, and I will tell her future siblings about her. She'll forever be our Elizabeth Vimy Alexander❤

1735,Miscarriage,"So through this experience I have only recently come to realize how difficult it is for women to get through the beuracratic tape for testing regarding their reproductive health. It is such a frustrating and horrible thing to have to experience a loss and then have to beg doctors to look into your health, or get hit with an astronomical price tag due to the mark ups on fertility testing. That being said I wanted to try and create a resource for us to be able to make independent decisions about OUR health like the GROWN ASS WOMEN AND MEN we are. 😂 So if you know of resource please comment  so I can add it to the list.

1736,Miscarriage,"It was our first try. My ovulation was 29th of last month and we actively had intercourses around that day. I have been patiently waiting to get a home pregnancy test on 14th of this month. I am pretty sure that we had it. I had all different early pregnancy symptoms (fatigue, swollen breast, bloating and etc.) Starting from four days ago, 5th, I felt slight cramp which could have been from the implantation. And then,, I made a mistake. I went on a backpacking trip on 6th-8th. The tent was much hotter than I expected. I woke up during the nap because I was so annoyed with the heat. Also, I walked for 13 miles with a heavy backpack when I had a mild cramp. I did this all because I have been backpacking every two weeks and I am strong with the heat in general. We returned home yesterday. It was a nice trip, I thought. However, I’ve had more intense cramps today with quite a lot of blood. This is nothing like what people describe about the implantation spotting. I regret it..... How long will my body take to recover, so that we can try to conceive again..... I have been laying on my bed reading about how long my body will take to drop HCG level and such. This cramp is worse that my usual period cramp. I deserve it. I learned a lesson in a hard way.

1738,Miscarriage,"I had a miscarriage at 21 weeks with twins a week after I had found out their genders .. I was so excited little did I know how short lived it would be. Having to go through labour and knowing there was nothing they could do to save them was the first feeling ever. This happened to me in September 2018 and I was only 20 at the time but writing this is giving me chills whenever it crosses my mind I get that heart wrenching feeling I felt all over again as I laid in that labour ward knowing I wouldn’t be leaving that hospital with my children 💔. No one around me really understands how this has impacted my life or remotely how I feel. They think they do but they don’t, I have cut off so many family and friends since this and it’s not even cos the majority of them knew as only a few people knew I just noticed so much shady behaviour afterwards. I just don’t feel hopeful about anything anymore. I try to be positive but it doesn’t ever last. I just hope God has a plan for me because this feeling is awful.

1740,Miscarriage,"Hey- Im fairly certain I'm having an early miscarriage/ chemical pregnancy. Been testing like crazy, and there was a pretty clear drop today in my tests. I've had cramping since I first learned I was pregnant at 10dpo. Spotting started at 12dpo and lasted until 13dpo. Spotting stopped but cramping continues. Just occasionally getting a prolonged cramp - still different from typical menstruation cramps though. My tests seemed darkest at 12dpo and I feel like its probably been decreasing since then.  Anyways, my test today with first response is lightwr than whag is was o  10dpo. Anyways, basically wondering when I should expect to start bleeding? When this will be over? Also, I've been a wreck last few days and am heading into a full day of work today. Fuck. I'm not functioning. Ive been a complete mess.  Doctor basically said its common and I'll be fine and wouldn't even do blood tests to confirm.  I'm alone bc my husband had to go across country for work. Ugh.",t3_ho3ln3
1741,Miscarriage,"Hi it’s me again! I know I’ve been posting kind of nonstop so for that I apologize. I guess it’s just really nice to have a community of women who can understand what I’m going through and can offer suggestions and advice.

My question is, I had my d&amp;c yesterday morning and it’s left me with horrible throat pain. It is extremely painful when I swallow and then also painful just in general. I had no throat irritation or pain prior to the surgery so I’m fairly certain this is surgery related. Did anyone else experience this? It seems like such an odd side effect!",t3_ho1twf
1742,Miscarriage,"So, even though I thought I was out of the woods at 9 weeks 4 days it seems like my body had different plans.

I started spotting brown two days ago, went to A&amp;E and they were very reassuring that these things happen all the time and I shouldn't panic. But they did  book me in for an ultrasound the following day to check everything is ok.

After I came home I noticed that the blood was getting less brown and more red and slightly increasing in volume but I still thought that maybe it could be a hematoma or something else causing it. Had a good cry which tired me out and was finally able to go to sleep due to the sheer mental exhaustion of worrying and not knowing what's happening inside there.

Around 3am I woke up because I started feeling menstrual like cramping, not very severe but enough to make me think that my uterus is definitely trying to clean up shop. I stayed awake in silence just observing my cramping, knowing that there was nothing I could do...and at one point I just thought of all the millions of other strong women who have gone through the same sort of experience and I felt this weird sense of kinship and peace thinking about this shared experience. I knew it was awful but I also knew from being around my bumper group that there's a light at the end of the tunnel eventually. I accepted that I was most likely miscarrying.

In the morning when I woke up there was quite a lot of blood that poured out when I went to the loo but I just thought at this point everything is already in motion, no way to stop it. Still...it didn't make it any easier seeing it everytime I had to pee... I did wish I could just shove a menstrual cup in there to catch everything but I knew it isn't recommended 🙄

Fast forward to yesterday at 14:00 after a two hour wait for the ultrasound I finally went in and had confirmation that I was no longer pregnant. It seems like I had most likely passed the pregnancy in the morning without realising it - which I'm grateful for in a weird way that at least the worst part is behind me and I wont have to get a D&amp;C (hopefully).

I'm feeling oddly calm and at peace with the whole thing. During the whole pregnancy I barely had any symptoms, almost no nausea, no cravings no nothing so maybe that's what's helping me process this easier as I never fully *felt* pregnant...don't know, I'm just rambling at this point...

I'd like to end it on a positive note though, when I told my parents about the misscariage and I was saying how sorry I was that I had to give them this bad news so quickly after telling them about the pregnancy, my dad said something really lovely: 

*Don't worry about sharing things with us, the joy we felt when you told us about the pregnancy far outweighs the sadness we feel now that it's over*

And he's right, I'm not sorry this pregnancy happened even if it did end in a misscariage. My S/O and I got to be so happy for a while - making plans for the future, imagining what we'll be like as parents and just generally feeling closer than we've ever been. I said pregnancy felt like the moments after you buy a lottery ticket and spend time talking about what you would do with the money - who you would help, where you would travel - there's value and joy in these things we imagine living through even though they don't necessarily happen ❤️ 

Anyway, didn't think I would be part of this group but here I am. Thank you to all of you sharing your stories as they're helping me process my own.",t3_hnfh9a
1743,Miscarriage,"I’m just trying to make sense of all this and I would love some advice and support if anyone has any. 

Last week I was feeling terrible (constant nausea; very sore, heavy, and growing breasts; headaches; moodiness), and I decided to take a pregnancy test. I’m on a medication that has stopped my period since December so I knew the fastest way to figure out what was going on was to take the test. It was positive. 

The next day I started bleeding. This was obviously worrisome, though the pregnancy was unplanned. Because I have endometriosis, I cramp, bleed, and pass a lot of clots with a normal period. All of this was present last week and stressful in light of the positive test. I didn’t and still don’t know what to make of it. 

The next day I called my doctor. After asking some questions, she was able to surmise that I had been about 4 weeks pregnant and was likely miscarrying. Cue a bit of panic on my part. After some tests and a visit to her office, she’s concluded that I am now not pregnant. 

I honestly don’t know how I should be feeling. That may sound silly, but on a lot of levels I feel that I don’t deserve to grieve an unplanned pregnancy that was four weeks along when there is far greater loss out there. But I also feel grief. I also feel guilty about losing the pregnancy. I feel silly for not knowing how to feel. I don’t have a great support system so I feel a bit of relief. Then I feel extremely guilty for feeling relief. Then the roller coaster begins again. 

My boyfriend wants to know how I’m feeling to he can attend to those feelings, which is great, but my feelings change minute by minute. He wants to be able to fix everything and move on, and I don’t think this works like that. I don’t understand how it works, though. 

Does anybody have any tips for dealing with a very early/chemical loss like this? Or any suggestions to help a partner understand what I am going through? Any advice is appreciated, though I am certainly not owed any from internet strangers. ♥️",t3_hnvt0n
1744,Miscarriage,"This was my first pregnancy so obviously it's my first miscarriage. Went in for my second ultrasound this week today and they confirmed the pregnancy isn't progressing. So now I wait to hear from my doctor so I can move on from here physically. I have no idea what to expect aside from what I've read here so any advice is greatly appreciated.

As far as how I feel, I'm still very excited about the idea of having a baby. My husband and I are doing our best to make peace with it not working out this time. I was going to be due a month after graduating from a program I'm taking to change careers and finishing up work at the place I've been employed for the past 5 years, so it was going to be A LOT of change at once. I was trying to be calm about it but it seemed super overwhelming when I thought about it. We're ready to be parents but we didn't think we'd get pregnant as early as we did. So we're staying positive. This sucks but we're still looking forward.",t3_hnlk9i
1745,Miscarriage,"I had a CP mid-March where I had five days of positive tests that got dark for a few days but then lighter. It was my first pregnancy. I never called or went to an OB because the tests lightened over a weekend and it was also right when covid was getting bad in my area.

Then in May we conceived again and I had a missed miscarriage at 6+1, with a d&amp;c at 9+4 two weeks ago. I mentioned to my midwife it was technically my second loss and asked if I could see a RE to get testing. I know they say you have to have 3 losses before you can get tested but I've seen some places say after 2 losses, if you're older, to pursue it so I figured why not, since I'll be 35 in a few months.

So my midwife scheduled me to have a ""preconception appointment"" but it was not with an RE, it was with an OB who is in the same practice as her. I saw him this morning and it was extremely underwhelming. I didn't have high hopes or anything but it was more of a bummer than I'd expected. I knew there was a chance I'd be told ""insurance won't cover testing until 3 losses"" but what really surprised and frustrated me is that he said my CP ""doesn't count"" and that I'd need to have 3 first trimester losses, not including any past or future CPs, before I can undergo testing.

Does a CP really ""not count"", either according to your doctor or an insurance company? Has anyone else experienced this?

He also heavily implied I was not even pregnant the first time so in general his bedside manner really sucked. I told him I have 5 days of positive pregnancy tests I could show him, I was definitely pregnant even though it was brief. Ugh. I just felt so dismissed and stupid for even being there.

I live in a rural area with few providers, however I will be looking into seeing if I can change practices or doctors, or at least make sure I do not have to deal with this guy again. 

But I'm wondering if this is typical or not, and if not, what else I could do at this point. I had been thinking it's already unfair and shitty enough I might have to have one more loss, but now thinking I'd have to have two, plus more if I have other CPs that ""won't count"" is too much to bear. I know testing doesn't always give you answers but I'd rather know now than wait to experience more pain, and as I am getting older each passing month feels like just more lost valuable time so I was just trying to be proactive and advocate for myself 😕",t3_hnkuqo
1746,Miscarriage,"I just had a d&amp;c this morning and peed for the first time. One weird thing that happened is that although I felt like I REALLY needed to go, it took a while to start peeing? And then afterwards it left me in some discomfort. Anyone else experience this?

Also I just wanted to say that this community has helped me so much. In fact it even made me less nervous for my procedure because I had read about so many of your stories and knew what to expect. So a giant thank you!",t3_hnr28r
1747,Miscarriage,"I had my first miscarriage (first pregnancy) at the beginning of June. 9 weeks, natural. I started bleeding, and the bleeding just never stopped, until it did. Given COVID, my husband couldn’t come to any appointments. My doctor had to say, “Oh, screw it” in order to give me a hug as I sat there alone. I feel like I had a day to cry and then the world just kept turning. The pandemic is still looming. Work still has its stressors. What am I cooking for dinner? Nobody mentions it. We all seem to have brushed past it and let it stay there on that Tuesday in June.

But every now and then, something triggers a reminder. Someone announces their new little one coming in 7 months on Facebook. Ads want me to buy a fucking baby toy subscription. The prenatal vitamins sit on the bathroom counter. And it feels like I’m stuck in a cycle where I forget it ever happened and then get reminded. Rinse, repeat.

I don’t know if this is a shared experience, and I know from other experiences of grief that it comes in waves. But just wanted to say that if you’re going through this, and you forget and then suddenly you don’t, I feel you, and I send you love.",t3_hn5vm7
1748,Miscarriage,"Hi everyone, I took Misoprostol (3 x 200mcg tabs sublingually this morning at 08h00) by 11h00 I had really bad cramping. Passed one clot and a fair amount of frank blood. Took the next dose of 3 sublingual 200mcg miso tablets. Then took a tablet that combines Meprobamate, Acetaminophen and Codeine at 11h30. That really settled my pain. Fell asleep at around 13h00. Woke up and haven't passed any more big clots, hardly bleeding and just feel bloated not crampy. I'm starting to worry that it hasn't worked properly (time is now 15h12).",t3_hngtny
1749,Miscarriage,"I just want to say thank you to anyone who can help, 2 months ago my girlfriend missed her period, and a few weeks later, she miscarried. She is torn up, I’ll admit I’m honestly distraught about it, but don’t want her to know how upset I actually am. I am trying to remind her as much as I can that she’s not broken, we still have time to actually try (both early 20’s, was not a planned pregnancy.) I can’t help but feel as though I’m 0 help, I want to be there as much as I can because being a mother is one of the only things she’s ever wanted and she’s terrified it’s “her fault.” Is there any groups I can to for advice? A men’s support group almost? Or somewhere I can recommend she look (she doesn’t have a reddit, and I also don’t want her to see my post here, she may feel a little betrayed that I’m taking about it.) 

Any and all help is more than welcome, thank you so much, and I’m very sorry for any of your losses.",t3_hncokw
1750,Miscarriage,"How are you and your partner handling your miscarriage? I love my husband but it’s very difficult for him to understand what I’m going through. He can’t understand the pain, both physical and emotional. The fact that I had something growing inside of me and now it’s dying inside of me. I try to explain it to him but it’s difficult. 

I’ll admit I get frustrated and snappy at times. I’ve found myself sitting in my bedroom alone because I just want to be alone. I get angry because he just doesn’t get it. I don’t want to feel or act this way but I do. Anyone else? Hoping I’m not just a bitch haha",t3_hn8oyu
1751,Miscarriage,"I found out I was pregnant last Sunday. Honestly, I couldn’t tell you what inspired me to take the test. Maybe it was my dog starting to act weird around me, maybe it was the constant thirst and bloat, or maybe it was just a feeling. Couldn’t believe it when I saw that second line. I was in disbelief. I dont have periods naturally and have been struggling to get a diagnosis for a few years. My husband was in shock. I took 8 different kinds of pregnancy tests just to be sure. Low and behold I was with child. I told everyone right away, I was way to excited not to.

On Saturday, I started passing brown blood clots. I told my husband I think I’m having a miscarriage and he told me I’m fine wait for my appointment on the 13th. Sunday I started passing more little blood clots and bleeding like a light period. Called the OB trying to get an appointment sooner, no one can get me in. Without health insurance I can’t afford to go to the ER, my last visit cost me $2k and that’s without an ultrasound. ( my health insurance dosent kick in until Sept. 1st so all appointments are being paid for out of pocket) I start praying.  Monday I start bleeding and passing blood clots like a light period every time I wipe. Tuesday light period enough to stain a panty liner. My mom tells me it’s normal to bleed during pregnancy. I’ve been obsessively taking pregnancy tests and have watched the line get lighter. No one is acknowledging  my loss. I have to wait for Monday to get the official diagnosis but I already know what the dr will say. I feel like the whole world has stopped turning. I don’t know how to act around people, I pretend to be okay but I’m on a rollercoaster of emotion and no one wants to talk about it. I fell in live with that fetus after only knowing about it for a week. Made a registry. Downloaded all the apps. Took my prenatal vitamin. Started taking walks. I was ready to be a mom. My husband dosent want to try for a baby for two years. I feel like I was given a gift only to have it ripped from me and I don’t understand the purpose of it. I’m just trying to make peace but can’t begin the grieving process since I haven’t received the diagnosis and I don’t want to hold on to any shred of hope for fear that I will break. It seems as if I’m in my own personal hell. I’m so happy I found this sub and can finally get my feelings out into the open. I’m in pain. I’m hurting. I feel unbearable loss.",t3_hnbstr
1752,Miscarriage,"I miscarried a 9 days ago on June 29th @ 5 weeks and now I’m starting to doubt it even happened. 

My husband was home when it happened and was in the bathroom with me when i passed a lot of blood. I bled into pads for 2 days after (never filling them but consistently light flow). I had intense cramps for the the first few days. For the past few days i have had cramps again and brown spotting. I have felt extreme fatigue and nausea. 

I called the gyn on June 30th (crying). They said that i should keep my first pregnancy apt that i had scheduled for July 22 &amp; they’ll test my levels then as they should be lowered back down by then. 

My husband feels sure that i did have a miscarriage but now I feel like I’m in denial. I want to start trying again soon but I’m actually just really hoping that I’m wrong and it didn’t actually happen. 

Feeling sad and confused.",t3_hn8bu1
1753,Miscarriage,"In the past year, I’ve had an MMC (Aug 2019) and 4 chemical pregnancy. I thought that this pregnancy was going to be different but just heard from my doctor that there hasn’t been any growth in the past week. I don’t know why I’m so devastated, I feel like with my history I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up but it still hurts so damn bad.",t3_hn2cae
